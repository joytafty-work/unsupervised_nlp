i have a tough job to do you know when i looked at the profile of the audience here with their connotations and design in all its forms and with so much and so many people working on collaborative and networks and so on that i wanted to tell you i wanted to build an argument for primary education in a very specific context in order to do that in 20 minutes i have to bring out four ideas it s like four pieces of a puzzle and if i succeed in doing that maybe you would go back with the thought that you could build on and perhaps help me do my work the first piece of the puzzle is remoteness and the quality of education now by remoteness i mean two or three different kinds of things of course remoteness in its normal sense which means that as you go further and further away from an urban center you get to remoter areas what happens to education the second or a different kind of remoteness is that within the large metropolitan areas all over the world you have pockets like slums or shantytowns or poorer areas which are socially and economically remote from the rest of the city so it s us and them what happens to education in that context so keep both of those ideas of remoteness we made a guess the guess was that schools in remote areas do not have good enough teachers if they do have they cannot retain those teachers they do not have good enough infrastructure and if they had some infrastructure they have difficulty maintaining it but i wanted to check if this is true so what i did last year was we hired a car looked up on google found a route into northern india from new delhi which you know which did not cross any big cities or any big metropolitan centers drove out about 300 kilometers and wherever we found a school administered a set of standard tests and then took those test results and plotted them on a graph the graph was interesting although you need to consider it carefully i mean this is a very small sample you should not generalize from it but it was quite obvious quite clear that for this particular route that i had taken the remoter the school was the worse its results seemed to be that seemed a little damning and i tried to correlate it with things like infrastructure or with the availability of electricity and things like that to my surprise it did not correlate it did not correlate with the size of classrooms it did not correlate with the quality of the infrastructure it did not correlate with the poverty levels it did not correlate but what happened was that when i administered a questionnaire to each of these schools with one single question for the teachers which was would you like to move to an urban metropolitan area 69 percent of them said yes and as you can see from that they say yes just a little bit out of delhi and they say no when you hit the rich suburbs of delhi because you know those are relatively better off areas and then from 200 kilometers out of delhi the answer is consistently yes i would imagine that a teacher who comes or walks into class every day thinking that i wish i was in some other school probably has a deep impact on what happens to the results so it looked as though teacher motivation and teacher migration was a powerfully correlated thing with what was happening in primary schools as opposed to whether the children have enough to eat and whether they are packed tightly into classrooms and that sort of thing it appears that way when you take education and technology then i find in the literature that you know things like websites collaborative environments you ve been listening to all that in the morning it s always piloted first in the best schools the best urban schools and according to me biases the result the literature one part of it the scientific literature consistently blames et as being over hyped and under performing the teachers always say well it s fine but it s too expensive for what it does because it s being piloted in a school where the students are already getting let s say 80 percent of whatever they could do you put in this new super duper technology and now they get 83 percent so the principal looks at it and says 3 percent for 300 000 dollars forget it if you took the same technology and piloted it into one of those remote schools where the score was 30 percent and let s say took that up to 40 percent that will be a completely different thing so the relative change that et educational technology would make would be far greater at the bottom of the pyramid than at the top but we seem to be doing it the other way about so i came to this conclusion that et should reach the underprivileged first not the other way about and finally came the question of how do you tackle teacher perception whenever you go to a teacher and show them some technology the teacher s first reaction is you cannot replace a teacher with a machine it s impossible i do n t know why it s impossible but even for a moment if you did assume that it s impossible i have a quotation from sir arthur c clarke the science fiction writer whom i met in colombo and he said something which completely solves this problem he said a teacher than can be replaced by a machine should be so you know it puts the teacher into a tough bind you have to think anyway so i m proposing that an alternative primary education whatever alternative you want is required where schools do n t exist where schools are not good enough where teachers are not available or where teachers are not good enough for whatever reason if you happen to live in a part of the world where none of this applies then you do n t need an alternative education so far i have n t come across such an area except for one case i wo n t name the area but somewhere in the world people said we do n t have this problem because we have perfect teachers and perfect schools there are such areas but anyway i d never heard that anywhere else i m going to talk about children and self organization and a set of experiments which sort of led to this idea of what might an alternative education be like they re called the hole in the wall experiments i ll have to really rush through this they re a set of experiments the first one was done in new delhi in 1999 and what we did over there was pretty much simple i had an office in those days which bordered a slum an urban slum so there was a dividing wall between our office and the urban slum they cut a hole inside that wall which is how it has got the name hole in the wall and put a pretty powerful pc into that hole sort of embedded into the wall so that its monitor was sticking out at the other end a touchpad similarly embedded into the wall put it on high speed internet put the internet explorer there put it on altavista com in those days and just left it there and this is what we saw so that was my office in iit here s the hole in the wall about eight hours later we found this kid to the right is this eight year old child who and to his left is a six year old girl who is not very tall and what he was doing was he was teaching her to browse so it sort of raised more questions than it answered is this real does the language matter because he s not supposed to know english will the computer last or will they break it and steal it and did anyone teach them the last question is what everybody said but you know i mean they must have poked their head over the wall and asked the people in your office can you show me how to do it and then somebody taught him so i took the experiment out of delhi and repeated it this time in a city called shivpuri in the center of india where i was assured that nobody had ever taught anybody anything so it was a warm day and the hole in the wall was on that decrepit old building this is the first kid who came there he later on turned out to be a 13 year old school dropout he came there and he started to fiddle around with the touchpad very quickly he noticed that when he moves his finger on the touchpad something moves on the screen and later on he told me i have never seen a television where you can do something so he figured that out it took him over two minutes to figure out that he was doing things to the television and then as he was doing that he made an accidental click by hitting the touchpad you ll see him do that he did that and the internet explorer changed page eight minutes later he looked from his hand to the screen and he was browsing he was going back and forth when that happened he started calling all the neighborhood children like children would come and see what s happening over here and by the evening of that day 70 children were all browsing so eight minutes and an embedded computer seemed to be all that we needed there so we thought that this is what was happening that children in groups can self instruct themselves to use a computer and the internet but under what circumstances at this time there was a the main question was about english people said you know you really ought to have this in indian languages so i said have what shall i translate the internet into some indian language that s not possible so it has to be the other way about but let s see how do the children tackle the english language i took the experiment out to northeastern india to a village called madantusi where for some reason there was no english teacher so the children had not learned english at all and i built a similar hole in the wall one big difference in the villages as opposed to the urban slums there were more girls than boys who came to the kiosk in the urban slums the girls tend to stay away i left the computer there with lots of cds i did n t have any internet and came back three months later so when i came back there i found these two kids eight and 12 year olds who were playing a game on the computer and as soon as they saw me they said we need a faster processor and a better mouse i was real surprised you know how on earth did they know all this and they said well we ve picked it up from the cds so i said but how did you understand what s going on over there so they said well you ve left this machine which talks only in english so we had to learn english so then i measured and they were using 200 english words with each other mispronounced but correct usage words like exit stop find save that kind of thing not only to do with the computer but in their day to day conversations so madantusi seemed to show that language is not a barrier in fact they may be able to teach themselves the language if they really wanted to finally i got some funding to try this experiment out to see if these results are replicable if they happen everywhere else india is a good place to do such an experiment in because we have all the ethnic diversities all the you know the genetic diversity all the racial diversities and also all the socio economic diversities so i could actually choose samples to cover a cross section that would cover practically the whole world so i did this for almost five years and this experiment really took us all the way across the length and breadth of india this is the himalayas up in the north very cold i also had to check or invent an engineering design which would survive outdoors and i was using regular normal pcs so i needed different climates for which india is also great because we have very cold very hot and so on this is the desert to the west near the pakistan border and you see here a little clip of one of these villages the first thing that these children did was to find a website to teach themselves the english alphabet then to central india very warm moist fishing villages where humidity is a very big killer of electronics so we had to solve all the problems we had without air conditioning and with very poor power so most of the solutions that came out used little blasts of air put at the right places to keep the machines running i want to just cut this short we did this over and over again this sequence is also nice this is a small child a six year old telling his eldest sister what to do and this happens very often with these computers that the younger children are found teaching the older ones what did we find we found that six to 13 year olds can self instruct in a connected environment irrespective of anything that we could measure so if they have access to the computer they will teach themselves including intelligence i could n t find a single correlation with anything but it had to be in groups and that may be of great you know interest to this group because all of you are talking about groups so here was the power of what a group of children can do if you lift the adult intervention just a quick idea of the measurements we took standard statistical techniques so i m going to not talk about that but we got a clean learning curve almost exactly the same as what you would get in a school i ll leave it at that because i mean it sort of says it all does n t it what could they learn to do basic windows functions browsing painting chatting and email games and educational material music downloads playing video in short what all of us do and over 300 children will become computer literate and be able to do all of these things in six months with one computer so how do they do that if you calculated the actual time of access it would work out to minutes per day so that s not how it s happening what you have actually is there is one child operating the computer and surrounding him are usually three other children who are advising him on what they should do if you test them all four will get the same scores in whatever you ask them around these four are usually a group of about 16 children who are also advising usually wrongly about everything that s going on on the computer and all of them also will clear a test given on that subject so they are learning as much by watching as they learn by doing it seems counter intuitive to adult learning but remember eight year olds live in a society where most of the time they are told do n t do this you know do n t touch the whiskey bottle so what does the eight year old do he observes very carefully how a whiskey bottle should be touched and if you tested him he would answer every question correctly on that topic so they seem to be able to acquire very quickly so what was the conclusion over the six years of work it was that primary education can happen on its own or parts of it can happen on its own it does not have to be imposed from the top downwards it could perhaps be a self organizing system so that was the second bit that i wanted to tell you that children can self organize and attain an educational objective the third piece was on values and again to put it very briefly i conducted a test over 500 children spread across all over india and asked them i gave them about 68 different values oriented questions and simply asked them their opinions we got all sorts of opinions yes no or i do n t know i simply took those questions where i got 50 percent yeses and 50 percent noes so i was able to get a collection of 16 such statements these were areas where the children were clearly confused because half said yes and half said no a typical example being sometimes it is necessary to tell lies they do n t have a way to determine which way to answer this question perhaps none of us do so i leave you with this third question can technology alter the acquisition of values finally self organizing systems about which again i wo n t say too much because you ve been hearing all about it natural systems are all self organizing galaxies molecules cells organisms societies except for the debate about an intelligent designer but at this point in time as far as science goes it s self organization but other examples are traffic jams stock market society and disaster recovery terrorism and insurgency and you know about the internet based self organizing systems so here are my four sentences then remoteness affects the quality of education educational technology should be introduced into remote areas first and other areas later values are acquired doctrine and dogma are imposed the two opposing mechanisms and learning is most likely a self organizing system if you put all the four together then it gives according to me it gives us a goal a vision for educational technology an educational technology and pedagogy that is digital automatic fault tolerant minimally invasive connected and self organized as educationists we have never asked for technology we keep borrowing it powerpoint is supposed to be considered a great educational technology but it was not meant for education it was meant for making boardroom presentations we borrowed it video conferencing the personal computer itself i think it s time that the educationists made their own specs and i have such a set of specs this is a brief look at that and such a set of specs should produce the technology to address remoteness values and violence so i thought i d give it a name why do n t we call it outdoctrination and could this be a goal for educational technology in the future so i want to leave that as a thought with you thank you
