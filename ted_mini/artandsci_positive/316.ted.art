so i m going to talk today about collecting stories in some unconventional ways this is a picture of me from a very awkward stage in my life you might enjoy the awkwardly tight cut off pajama bottoms with balloons anyway it was a time when i was mainly interested in collecting imaginary stories so this is a picture of me holding one of the first watercolor paintings i ever made and recently i ve been much more interested in collecting stories from reality so real stories and specifically i m interested in collecting my own stories stories from the internet and then recently stories from life which is kind of a new area of work that i ve been doing recently so i ll be talking about each of those today so first of all my own stories these are two of my sketchbooks i have many of these books and i ve been keeping them for about the last eight or nine years they accompany me wherever i go in my life and i fill them with all sorts of things records of my lived experience so watercolor paintings drawings of what i see dead flowers dead insects pasted ticket stubs rusting coins business cards writings and in these books you can find these short little glimpses of moments and experiences and people that i meet and you know after keeping these books for a number of years i started to become very interested in collecting not only my own personal artifacts but also the artifacts of other people so i started collecting found objects this is a photograph i found lying in a gutter in new york city about 10 years ago on the front you can see the tattered black and white photo of a woman s face and on the back it says to judy the girl with the bill bailey voice have fun in whatever you do and i really loved this idea of the partial glimpse into somebody s life as opposed to knowing the whole story just knowing a little bit of the story and then letting your own mind fill in the rest and that idea of a partial glimpse is something that will come back in a lot of the work i ll be showing later today so around this time i was studying computer science at princeton university and i noticed that it was suddenly possible to collect these sorts of personal artifacts not just from street corners but also from the internet and that suddenly people en masse were leaving scores and scores of digital footprints online that told stories of their private lives blog posts photographs thoughts feelings opinions all of these things were being expressed by people online and leaving behind trails so i started to write computer programs that study very very large sets of these online footprints one such project is about a year and a half old it s called we feel fine this is a project that scans the world s newly posted blog entries every two or three minutes searching for occurrences of the phrases i feel and i am feeling and when it finds one of those phrases it grabs the full sentence up to the period and also tries to identify demographic information about the author so their gender their age their geographic location and what the weather conditions were like when they wrote that sentence it collects about 20 000 such sentences a day and it s been running for about a year and a half having collected over 10 and a half million feelings now this is then how they re presented these dots here represent some of the english speaking world s feelings from the last few hours each dot being a single sentence stated by a single blogger and the color of each dot corresponds to the type of feeling inside so the bright ones are happy and the dark ones are sad and the diameter of each dot corresponds to the length of the sentence inside so the small ones are short and the bigger ones are longer i feel fine with the body i m in there ll be no easy excuse for why i still feel uncomfortable being close to my boyfriend from a twenty two year old in japan i got this on some trading locally but really do n t feel like screwing with wiring and crap also some of the feelings contain photographs in the blog posts and when that happens these montage compositions are automatically created which consist of the sentence and images being combined and any of these can be opened up to reveal the sentence inside i feel good i feel rough now and i probably gained 100 000 pounds but it was worth it i love how they were able to preserve most in everything that makes you feel close to nature butterflies man made forests limestone caves and hey even a huge python so the next movement is called mobs this provides a slightly more statistical look at things this is showing the world s most common feelings overall right now dominated by better then bad then good then guilty and so on weather causes the feelings to assume the physical traits of the weather they represent so the sunny ones swirl around the cloudy ones float along the rainy ones fall down and the snowy ones flutter to the ground you can also stop a raindrop and open the feeling inside finally location causes the feelings to move to their spots on a world map giving you a sense of their geographic distribution so i ll show you now some of my favorite montages from we feel fine these are the images that are automatically constructed i feel like i m diagonally parked in a parallel universe i ve kissed numerous other boys and it has n t felt good the kisses felt messy and wrong but kissing lucas feels beautiful and almost spiritual i can feel my cancer grow i feel pretty i feel skinny but i m not i m 23 and a recovering meth and heroin addict and feel absolutely blessed to still be alive i ca n t wait to see them racing for the first time at daytona next month because i feel the need for speed i feel sassy i feel so sexy in this new wig as you can see we feel fine collects very very small scale personal stories sometimes stories as short as two or three words so really even challenging the notion of what can be considered a story and recently i ve become interested in diving much more deeply into a single story and that s led me to doing some work with the physical world not with the internet and only using the internet at the very last moment as a presentation medium so these are some newer projects that actually are n t even launched publicly yet the first such one is called the whale hunt last may i spent nine days living up in barrow alaska the northernmost settlement in the united states with a family of inupiat eskimos documenting their annual spring whale hunt this is the whaling camp here we re about six miles from shore camping on five and a half feet of thick frozen pack ice and that water that you see there is the open lead and through that lead bowhead whales migrate north each springtime and the eskimo community basically camps out on the edge of the ice here waits for a whale to come close enough to attack and when it does it throws a harpoon at it and then hauls the whale up under the ice and cuts it up and that would provide the community s food supply for a long time so i went up there and i lived with these guys out in their whaling camp here and photographed the entire experience beginning with the taxi ride to newark airport in new york and ending with the butchering of the second whale seven and a half days later i photographed that entire experience at five minute intervals so every five minutes i took a photograph when i was awake with the camera around my neck when i was sleeping with a tripod and a timer and then in moments of high adrenaline like when something exciting was happening i would up that photographic frequency to as many as 37 photographs in five minutes so what this created was a photographic heartbeat that sped up and slowed down more or less matching the changing pace of my own heartbeat that was the first concept here the second concept was to use this experience to think about the fundamental components of any story what are the things that make up a story so stories have characters stories have concepts stories take place in a certain area they have contexts they have colors what do they look like they have time when did it take place dates when did it occur and in the case of the whale hunt also this idea of an excitement level the thing about stories though in most of the existing mediums that we re accustomed to things like novels radio photographs movies even lectures like this one we re very accustomed to this idea of the narrator or the camera position some kind of omniscient external body through whose eyes you see the story we re very used to this but if you think about real life it s not like that at all i mean in real life things are much more nuanced and complex and there s all of these overlapping stories intersecting and touching each other and so i thought it would be interesting to build a framework to surface those types of stories so in the case of the whale hunt how could we extract something like the story of simeon and crawford involving the concepts of wildlife tools and blood taking place on the arctic ocean dominated by the color red happening around 10 a m on may 3 with an excitement level of high so how to extract this order of narrative from this larger story i built a web interface for viewing the whale hunt that attempts to do just this so these are all 3 214 pictures taken up there this is my studio in brooklyn this is the arctic ocean and the butchering of the second whale seven days later you can start to see some of the story here told by color so this red strip signifies the color of the wallpaper in the basement apartment where i was staying and things go white as we move out onto the arctic ocean introduction of red down here when whales are being cut up you can see a timeline showing you the exciting moments throughout the story these are organized chronologically wheel provides a slightly more playful version of the same so these are also all the photographs organized chronologically and any of these can be clicked and then the narrative is entered at that position so here i am sleeping on the airplane heading up to alaska that s moby dick this is the food we ate this is in the patkotak s family living room in their house in barrow the boxed wine they served us cigarette break outside i do n t smoke this is a really exciting sequence of me sleeping this is out at whale camp on the arctic ocean this graph that i m clicking down here is meant to be reminiscent of a medical heartbeat graph showing the exciting moments of adrenaline this is the ice starting to freeze over the snow fence they built and so what i ll show you now is the ability to pull out sub stories so here you see the cast these are all of the people in the whale hunt and the two whales that were killed down here and we could do something as arbitrary as say extract the story of rony involving the concepts of blood and whales and tools taking place on the arctic ocean at ahkivgaq camp with the heartbeat level of fast and now we ve whittled down that whole story to just 29 matching photographs and then we can enter the narrative at that position and you can see rony cutting up the whale here these whales are about 40 feet long and weighing over 40 tons and they provide the food source for the community for much of the year skipping ahead a bit more here this is rony on the whale carcass they use no chainsaws or anything it s entirely just blades and an incredibly efficient process this is the guys on the rope pulling open the carcass this is the muktuk or the blubber all lined up for community distribution it s baleen moving on so what i m going to tell you about next is a very new thing it s not even a project yet so just yesterday i flew in here from singapore and before that i was spending two weeks in bhutan the small himalayan kingdom nestled between tibet and india and i was doing a project there about happiness interviewing a lot of local people so bhutan has this really wacky thing where they base most of their high level governmental decisions around the concept of gross national happiness instead of gross domestic product and they ve been doing this since the 70s and it leads to just a completely different value system it s an incredibly non materialistic culture where people do n t have a lot but they re incredibly happy so i went around and i talked to people about some of these ideas so i did a number of things i asked people a number of set questions and took a number of set photographs and interviewed them with audio and also took pictures i would start by asking people to rate their happiness between one and 10 which is kind of inherently absurd and then when they answered i would inflate that number of balloons and give them that number of balloons to hold so you have some really happy person holding 10 balloons and some really sad soul holding one balloon but you know even holding one balloon is like kind of happy and then i would ask them a number of questions like what was the happiest day in their life what makes them happy and then finally i would ask them to make a wish and when they made a wish i would write their wish onto one of the balloons and take a picture of them holding it so i m going to show you now just a few brief snippets of some of the interviews that i did some of the people i spoke with this is an 11 year old student he was playing cops and robbers with his friends running around town and they all had plastic toy guns his wish was to become a police officer he was getting started early those were his hands i took pictures of everybody s hands because i think you can often tell a lot about somebody from how their hands look i took a portrait of everybody and asked everybody to make a funny face a 17 year old student her wish was to have been born a boy she thinks that women have a pretty tough go of things in bhutan and it s a lot easier if you re a boy a 28 year old cell phone shop owner if you knew what paro looked like you d understand how amazing it is that there s a cell phone shop there he wanted to help poor people a 53 year old farmer she was chaffing wheat and that pile of wheat behind her had taken her about a week to make she wanted to keep farming until she dies you can really start to see the stories told by the hands here she was wearing this silver ring that had the word love engraved on it and she d found it in the road somewhere a 16 year old quarry worker this guy was breaking rocks with a hammer in the hot sunlight but he just wanted to spend his life as a farmer a 21 year old monk he was very happy he wanted to live a long life at the monastery he had this amazing series of hairs growing out of a mole on the left side of his face which i m told is very good luck he was kind of too shy to make a funny face a 16 year old student she wanted to become an independent woman i asked her about that and she said she meant that she does n t want to be married because in her opinion when you get married in bhutan as a woman your chances to live an independent life kind of end and so she had no interest in that a 24 year old truck driver there are these terrifyingly huge indian trucks that come careening around one lane roads with two lane traffic with 3 000 foot drop offs right next to the road and he was driving one of these trucks but all he wanted was to just live a comfortable life like other people a 24 year old road sweeper i caught her on her lunch break she d built a little fire to keep warm right next to the road her wish was to marry someone with a car she wanted a change in her life she lives in a little worker s camp right next to the road and she wanted a different lot on things an 81 year old itinerant farmer i saw this guy on the side of the road and he actually does n t have a home he travels from farm to farm each day trying to find work and then he tries to sleep at whatever farm he gets work at so his wish was to come with me so that he had somewhere to live he had this amazing knife that he pulled out of his gho and started brandishing when i asked him to make a funny face it was all good natured a 10 year old he wanted to join a school and learn to read but his parents did n t have enough money to send him to school he was eating this orange sugary candy that he kept dipping his fingers into and since there was so much saliva on his hands this orange paste started to form on his palms a 37 year old road worker one of the more touchy political subjects in bhutan is the use of indian cheap labor that they import from india to build the roads and then they send these people home once the roads are built so these guys were in a worker s gang mixing up asphalt one morning on the side of the highway his wish was to make some money and open a store a 75 year old farmer she was selling oranges on the side of the road i asked her about her wish and she said you know maybe i ll live maybe i ll die but i do n t have a wish she was chewing betel nut which caused her teeth over the years to turn very red finally this is a 26 year old nun i spoke to her wish was to make a pilgrimage to tibet i asked her how long she planned to live in the nunnery and she said well you know of course it s impermanent but my plan is to live here until i m 30 and then enter a hermitage and i said you mean like a cave and she said yeah like a cave and i said wow and how long will you live in the cave and she said well you know i think i d kind of like to live my whole life in the cave i just thought that was amazing i mean she spoke in a way with amazing english and amazing humor and amazing laughter that made her seem like somebody i could have bumped into on the streets of new york or in vermont where i m from but here she had been living in a nunnery for the last seven years i asked her a little bit more about the cave and what she planned would happen once she went there you know what if she saw the truth after just one year what would she do for the next 35 years in her life and this is what she said woman i think i m going to stay for 35 maybe maybe i ll die jonathan harris maybe you ll die woman yes jh 10 years woman yes yes jh 10 years that s a long time woman yes not maybe one 10 years maybe i can die within one year or something like that jh are you hoping to woman ah because you know it s impermanent jh yeah but yeah ok do you hope would you prefer to live in the cave for 40 years or to live for one year woman but i prefer for maybe 40 to 50 jh 40 to 50 yeah woman yes from then i m going to the heaven jh well i wish you the best of luck with it woman thank you jh i hope it s everything that you hope it will be so thank you again so much woman you re most welcome jh so if you caught that she said she hoped to die when she was around 40 that was enough life for her so the last thing we did very quickly is i took all those wish balloons there were 117 interviews 117 wishes and i brought them up to a place called dochula which is a mountain pass in bhutan at 10 300 feet one of the more sacred places in bhutan and up there there are thousands of prayer flags that people have spread out over the years and we re inflated all of the balloons put them up on a string and hung them up there among the prayer flags and they re actually still flying up there today so if any of you have any bhutan travel plans in the near future you can go check these out here are some images from that we said a buddhist prayer so that all these wishes could come true you can start to see some familiar balloons here to make some money and to open a store was the indian road worker thanks very much
