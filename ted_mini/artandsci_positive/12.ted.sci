thank you it s really an honor and a privilege to be here spending my last day as a teenager today i want to talk to you about the future but first i m going to tell you a bit about the past my story starts way before i was born my grandmother was on a train to auschwitz the death camp and she was going along the tracks and the tracks split and somehow we do n t really know exactly the whole story but the train took the wrong track and went to a work camp rather than the death camp my grandmother survived and married my grandfather they were living in hungary and my mother was born and when my mother was two years old the hungarian revolution was raging and they decided to escape hungary they got on a boat and yet another divergence the boat was either going to canada or to australia they got on and did n t know where they were going and ended up in canada so to make a long story short they came to canada my grandmother was a chemist she worked at the banting institute in toronto and at 44 she died of stomach cancer i never met my grandmother but i carry on her name her exact name eva vertes and i like to think i carry on her scientific passion too i found this passion not far from here actually when i was nine years old my family was on a road trip and we were in the grand canyon and i had never been a reader when i was young my dad had tried me with the hardy boys i tried nancy drew i tried all that and i just did n t like reading books and my mother bought this book when we were at the grand canyon called the hot zone it was all about the outbreak of the ebola virus and something about it just kind of drew me towards it there was this big sort of bumpy looking virus on the cover and i just wanted to read it i picked up that book and as we drove from the edge of the grand canyon to big sur and to actually here where we are today in monterey i read that book and from when i was reading that book i knew that i wanted to have a life in medicine i wanted to be like the explorers i d read about in the book who went into the jungles of africa went into the research labs and just tried to figure out what this deadly virus was so from that moment on i read every medical book i could get my hands on and i just loved it so much i was a passive observer of the medical world it was n t until i entered high school that i thought maybe now you know being a big high school kid i can maybe become an active part of this big medical world i was 14 and i emailed professors at the local university to see if maybe i could go work in their lab and hardly anyone responded but i mean why would they respond to a 14 year old anyway and i got to go talk to one professor dr jacobs who accepted me into the lab at that time i was really interested in neuroscience and wanted to do a research project in neurology specifically looking at the effects of heavy metals on the developing nervous system so i started that and worked in his lab for a year and found the results that i guess you d expect to find when you feed fruit flies heavy metals that it really really impaired the nervous system the spinal cord had breaks the neurons were crossing in every which way and from then i wanted to look not at impairment but at prevention of impairment so that s what led me to alzheimer s i started reading about alzheimer s and tried to familiarize myself with the research and at the same time when i was in the i was reading in the medical library one day and i read this article about something called purine derivatives and they seemed to have cell growth promoting properties and being naive about the whole field i kind of thought oh you have cell death in alzheimer s which is causing the memory deficit and then you have this compound purine derivatives that are promoting cell growth and so i thought maybe if it can promote cell growth it can inhibit cell death too and so that s the project that i pursued for that year and it s continuing now as well and found that a specific purine derivative called guanidine had inhibited the cell growth by approximately 60 percent so i presented those results at the international science fair which was just one of the most amazing experiences of my life and there i was awarded best in the world in medicine which allowed me to get in or at least get a foot in the door of the big medical world and from then on since i was now in this huge exciting world i wanted to explore it all i wanted it all at once but knew i could n t really get that and i stumbled across something called cancer stem cells and this is really what i want to talk to you about today about cancer at first when i heard of cancer stem cells i did n t really know how to put the two together i d heard of stem cells and i d heard of them as the panacea of the future the therapy of many diseases to come in the future perhaps but i d heard of cancer as the most feared disease of our time so how did the good and bad go together last summer i worked at stanford university doing some research on cancer stem cells and while i was doing this i was reading the cancer literature trying to again familiarize myself with this new medical field and it seemed that tumors actually begin from a stem cell this fascinated me the more i read the more i looked at cancer differently and almost became less fearful of it it seems that cancer is a direct result to injury if you smoke you damage your lung tissue and then lung cancer arises if you drink you damage your liver and then liver cancer occurs and it was really interesting there were articles correlating if you have a bone fracture and then bone cancer arises because what stem cells are they re these phenomenal cells that really have the ability to differentiate into any type of tissue so if the body is sensing that you have damage to an organ and then it s initiating cancer it s almost as if this is a repair response and the cancer the body is saying the lung tissue is damaged we need to repair the lung and cancer is originating in the lung trying to repair because you have this excessive proliferation of these remarkable cells that really have the potential to become lung tissue but it s almost as if the body has originated this ingenious response but ca n t quite control it it has n t yet become fine tuned enough to finish what has been initiated so this really really fascinated me and i really think that we ca n t think about cancer let alone any disease in such black and white terms if we eliminate cancer the way we re trying to do now with chemotherapy and radiation we re bombarding the body or the cancer with toxins or with radiation trying to kill it it s almost as if we re getting back to this starting point we re removing the cancer cells but we re revealing the previous damage that the body has tried to fix should n t we think about manipulation rather than elimination if somehow we can cause these cells to differentiate to become bone tissue lung tissue liver tissue whatever that cancer has been put there to do it would be a repair process we d end up better than we were before cancer so this really changed my view of looking at cancer and while i was reading all these articles about cancer it seemed that the articles a lot of them focused on you know the genetics of breast cancer and the genesis and the progression of breast cancer tracking the cancer through the body tracing where it is where it goes but it struck me that i d never heard of cancer of the heart or cancer of any skeletal muscle for that matter and skeletal muscle constitutes 50 percent of our body or over 50 percent of our body and so at first i kind of thought well maybe there s some obvious explanation why skeletal muscle does n t get cancer at least not that i know of so i looked further into it found as many articles as i could and it was amazing because it turned out that it was very rare some articles even went as far as to say that skeletal muscle tissue is resistant to cancer and furthermore not only to cancer but of metastases going to skeletal muscle and what metastases are is when the tumor when a piece breaks off and travels through the blood stream and goes to a different organ that s what a metastasis is it s the part of cancer that is the most dangerous if cancer was localized we could likely remove it or somehow you know it s contained it s very contained but once it starts moving throughout the body that s when it becomes deadly so the fact that not only did cancer not seem to originate in skeletal muscles but cancer did n t seem to go to skeletal muscle there seemed to be something here so these articles were saying you know skeletal metastasis to skeletal muscle is very rare but it was left at that no one seemed to be asking why so i decided to ask why at first the first thing i did was i emailed some professors who specialized in skeletal muscle physiology and pretty much said hey it seems like cancer does n t really go to skeletal muscle is there a reason for this and a lot of the replies i got were that muscle is terminally differentiated tissue meaning that you have muscle cells but they re not dividing so it does n t seem like a good target for cancer to hijack but then again this fact that the metastases did n t go to skeletal muscle made that seem unlikely and furthermore that nervous tissue brain gets cancer and brain cells are also terminally differentiated so i decided to ask why and here s some of i guess my hypotheses that i ll be starting to investigate this may at the sylvester cancer institute in miami and i guess i ll keep investigating until i get the answers but i know that in science once you get the answers inevitably you re going to have more questions so i guess you could say that i ll probably be doing this for the rest of my life some of my hypotheses are that when you first think about skeletal muscle there s a lot of blood vessels going to skeletal muscle and the first thing that makes me think is that blood vessels are like highways for the tumor cells tumor cells can travel through the blood vessels and you think the more highways there are in a tissue the more likely it is to get cancer or to get metastases so first of all i thought you know would n t it be favorable to cancer getting to skeletal muscle and as well cancer tumors require a process called angiogenesis which is really the tumor recruits the blood vessels to itself to supply itself with nutrients so it can grow without angiogenesis the tumor remains the size of a pinpoint and it s not harmful so angiogenesis is really a central process to the pathogenesis of cancer and one article that really stood out to me when i was just reading about this trying to figure out why cancer does n t go to skeletal muscle was that it had reported 16 percent of micro metastases to skeletal muscle upon autopsy 16 percent meaning that there were these pinpoint tumors in skeletal muscle but only 16 percent of actual metastases suggesting that maybe skeletal muscle is able to control the angiogenesis is able to control the tumors recruiting these blood vessels we use skeletal muscles so much it s the one portion of our body our heart s always beating we re always moving our muscles is it possible that muscle somehow intuitively knows that it needs this blood supply it needs to be constantly contracting so therefore it s almost selfish it s grabbing its blood vessels for itself therefore when a tumor comes into skeletal muscle tissue it ca n t get a blood supply and ca n t grow so this suggests that maybe if there is an anti angiogenic factor in skeletal muscle or perhaps even more an angiogenic routing factor so it can actually direct where the blood vessels grow this could be a potential future therapy for cancer and another thing that s really interesting is that there s this whole the way tumors move throughout the body it s a very complex system and there s something called the chemokine network and chemokines are essentially chemical attractants and they re the stop and go signals for cancer so a tumor expresses chemokine receptors and another organ a distant organ somewhere in the body will have the corresponding chemokines and the tumor will see these chemokines and migrate towards it is it possible that skeletal muscle does n t express this type of molecules and the other really interesting thing is that when skeletal muscle there s been several reports that when skeletal muscle is injured that s what correlates with metastases going to skeletal muscle and furthermore when skeletal muscle is injured that s what causes chemokines these signals saying cancer you can come to me the go signs for the tumors it causes them to highly express these chemokines so there s so much interplay here i mean there are so many possibilities for why tumors do n t go to skeletal muscle but it seems like by investigating by attacking cancer by searching where cancer is not there has got to be something there s got to be something that s making this tissue resistant to tumors and can we utilize can we take this property this compound this receptor whatever it is that s controlling these anti tumor properties and apply it to cancer therapy in general now one thing that kind of ties the resistance of skeletal muscle to cancer to the cancer as a repair response gone out of control in the body is that skeletal muscle has a factor in it called myod and what myod essentially does is it causes cells to differentiate into muscle cells so this compound myod has been tested on a lot of different cell types and been shown to actually convert this variety of cell types into skeletal muscle cells so is it possible that the tumor cells are going to the skeletal muscle tissue but once in contact inside the skeletal muscle tissue myod acts upon these tumor cells and causes them to become skeletal muscle cells maybe tumor cells are being disguised as skeletal muscle cells and this is why it seems as if it is so rare it s not harmful it has just repaired the muscle muscle is constantly being used constantly being damaged if every time we tore a muscle or every time we stretched a muscle or moved in a wrong way cancer occurred i mean everybody would have cancer almost and i hate to say that but it seems as though muscle cell possibly because of all its use has adapted faster than other body tissues to respond to injury to fine tune this repair response and actually be able to finish the process which the body wants to finish i really believe that the human body is very very smart and we ca n t counteract something the body is saying to do it s different when a bacteria comes into the body that s a foreign object we want that out but when the body is actually initiating a process and we re calling it a disease it does n t seem as though elimination is the right solution so even to go from there it s possible although far fetched that in the future we could almost think of cancer being used as a therapy if those diseases where tissues are deteriorating for example alzheimer s where the brain the brain cells die and we need to restore new brain cells new functional brain cells what if we could in the future use cancer a tumor put it in the brain and cause it to differentiate into brain cells that s a very far fetched idea but i really believe that it may be possible these cells are so versatile these cancer cells are so versatile we just have to manipulate them in the right way and again some of these may be far fetched but i figured if there s anywhere to present far fetched ideas it s here at ted so thank you very much
