i would like to tell you about a project which i started about 16 years ago and it s about making new forms of life and these are made of this kind of tube electricity tube we call it in holland and we can start a film about that and we can see a little bit backwards in time narrator eventually these beasts are going to live in herds on the beaches theo jansen is working hard on this evolution theo jansen i want to put these forms of life on the beaches and they should survive over there on their own in the future learning to live on their own and it ll take couple of more years to let them walk on their own narrator the mechanical beasts will not get their energy from food but from the wind the wind will move feathers on their back which will drive their feet the beast walks sideways on the wet sand of the beach with its nose pointed into the wind as soon as it walks into either the rolling surf or the dry sand it stops and walks in the opposite direction evolution has generated many species this is the animaris currens ventosa tj this is a herd and it is built according to genetical codes and it is a sort of race and each and every animal is different and the winning codes will multiply this is the wave going from left to right you can see this one and now it goes from yes now it goes from left to right this is a new generation a new family which is able to store the winds so the wings pump up air in lemonade bottles which are on top of that and they can use that energy in case the wind falls away and the tide is coming up and there is still a little bit of energy to reach the dunes and save their lives because they are drowned very easily i could show you this animal thank you so the proportion of the tubes in this animal is very important for the walking there are 11 numbers which i call the 11 holy numbers these are the distances of the tubes which make it walk that way in fact it s a new invention of the wheel it works the same as a wheel the axis of a wheel is staying on the same level and this hip is staying on the same level as well in fact this is better than a wheel because when you try to drive with your bicycle on the beach you will notice it s very hard to do and the feet just step over the sand and the wheel has to touch every piece of the ground in between so 5 000 years after the invention of the wheel we have a new wheel and i will show you in the next video can you start it please that very heavy loads can be moved there s a guy pushing there behind but can also walk on the wind very well it s 3 2 tons and this is working on the stored winds in the bottles it has a feeler where it can feel obstacles and turn around and that stuff you see is going to it the other way can i have the feeler here ok good so they have to survive all the dangers of the beach and one of the big dangers is the sea this is the sea and it must feel the water of the sea and this is the water feeler and what s very important is this tube it sucks in air normally but when it swallows water it feels the resistance of it so imagine that the animal is walking towards the sea as soon as it touches the water you should hear a sort of sound of running air yes so if it does n t feel it will be drowned ok here we have the brain of the animal in fact it is a step counter and it counts the steps it s a binary step counter so as soon it has been to the sea it changes the pattern of zeroes and ones here and it knows always where it is on the beach so it s very simple brain it says well there s the sea there are dunes and i m here so it s a sort of imagination of the simple world of the beach animal thank you one of the biggest enemies are the storms this is a part of the nose of the animaris percipiere and when the nose is fixed of the animal the whole animal is fixed so when the storm is coming up it drives a pin into the ground and the nose is fixed the whole animal is fixed the wind may turn but the animal will turn always its nose into the wind now another couple of years and these animals will survive on their own i still have to help them a lot thank you very much ladies and gentlemen
