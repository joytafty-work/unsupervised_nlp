on september 10 the morning of my seventh birthday i came downstairs to the kitchen where my mother was washing the dishes and my father was reading the paper or something and i sort of presented myself to them in the doorway and they said hey happy birthday and i said i m seven and my father smiled and said well you know what that means do n t you and i said yeah that i m going to have a party and a cake and get a lot of presents and my dad said well yes but more importantly being seven means that you ve reached the age of reason and you re now capable of committing any and all sins against god and man now i had heard this phrase age of reason before sister mary kevin had been bandying it about my second grade class at school but when she said it the phrase seemed all caught up in the excitement of preparations for our first communion and our first confession and everybody knew that was really all about the white dress and the white veil and anyway i had n t really paid all that much attention to that phrase age of reason so i said yeah yeah age of reason what does that mean again and my dad said well we believe in the catholic church that god knows that little kids do n t know the difference between right and wrong but when you re seven you re old enough to know better so you ve grown up and reached the age of reason and now god will start keeping notes on you and begin your permanent record and i said oh wait a minute you mean all that time up till today all that time i was so good god did n t notice it and my mom said well i noticed it and i thought how could i not have known this before how could it not have sunk in when they d been telling me all that being good and no real credit for it and worst of all how could i not have realized this very important information until the very day that it was basically useless to me so i said well mom and dad what about santa claus i mean santa claus knows if you re naughty or nice right and my dad said yeah but honey i think that s technically just between thanksgiving and christmas and my mother said oh bob stop it let s just tell her i mean she s seven julie there is no santa claus now this was actually not that upsetting to me my parents had this whole elaborate story about santa claus how they had talked to santa claus himself and agreed that instead of santa delivering our presents over the night of christmas eve like he did for every other family who got to open their surprises first thing christmas morning our family would give santa more time santa would come to our house while we were at nine o clock high mass on christmas morning but only if all of us kids did not make a fuss which made me very suspicious it was pretty obvious that it was really our parents giving us the presents i mean my dad had a very distinctive wrapping style and my mother s handwriting was so close to santa s plus why would santa save time by having to loop back to our house after he d gone to everybody else s there s only one obvious conclusion to reach from this mountain of evidence our family was too strange and weird for even santa claus to come visit and my poor parents were trying to protect us from the embarrassment this humiliation of rejection by santa who was jolly but let s face it he was also very judgmental so to find out that there was no santa claus at all was actually sort of a relief i left the kitchen not really in shock about santa but rather i was just dumbfounded about how i could have missed this whole age of reason thing it was too late for me but maybe i could help someone else someone who could use the information they had to fit two criteria they had to be old enough to be able to understand the whole concept of the age of reason and not yet seven the answer was clear my brother bill he was six well i finally found bill about a block away from our house at this public school playground it was a saturday and he was all by himself just kicking a ball against the side of a wall i ran up to him and said bill i just realized that the age of reason starts when you turn seven and then you re capable of committing any and all sins against god and man and bill said so and then i said so you re six you have a whole year to do anything you want to and god wo n t notice it and he said so and i said so so everything and i turned to run i was so angry with him but when i got to the top of the steps i turned around dramatically and said oh by the way bill there is no santa claus now i did n t know it at the time but i really was n t turning seven on september 10 for my 13th birthday i planned a slumber party with all of my girlfriends but a couple of weeks beforehand my mother took me aside and said i need to speak to you privately september 10 is not your birthday it s october 10 and i said what and she said listen the cut off date to start kindergarten was september 15 so i told them that your birthday was on september 10 and then i was n t sure that you were n t just going to go blab it all over the place so i started to tell you your birthday was september 10 but julie you were so ready to start school honey you were so ready i thought about it and when i was four i was already the oldest of four children and my mother even had another child to come so what i think she understandably really meant was that she was so ready she was so ready then she said do n t worry julie every year on october 10 when it was your birthday but you did n t realize it i made sure that you ate a piece of cake that day which was comforting but troubling my mother had been celebrating my birthday with me without me what was so upsetting about this new piece of information was not that i was going to have to change the date of my slumber party with all of my girlfriends what was most upsetting was that this meant that i was not a virgo i had a huge virgo poster in my bedroom and i read my horoscope every single day and it was so totally me and this meant that i was a libra so i took the bus downtown to get the new libra poster the virgo poster is a picture of a beautiful woman with long hair sort of lounging by some water but the libra poster is just a huge scale this was around the time that i started filling out physically and i was filling out a lot more than a lot of the other girls and frankly the whole idea that my astrological sign was a scale just seemed ominous and depressing but i got the new libra poster and i started to read my new libra horoscope and i was astonished to find that it was also totally me it was n t until years later looking back on this whole age of reason change of birthday thing that it dawned on me i was n t turning seven when i thought i turned seven i had a whole other month to do anything i wanted to before god started keeping tabs on me oh life can be so cruel one day two mormon missionaries came to my door now i just live off a main thoroughfare in los angeles and my block is well it s a natural beginning for people who are peddling things door to door sometimes i get little old ladies from the seventh day adventist church showing me these cartoon pictures of heaven and sometimes i get teenagers who promise me that they wo n t join a gang and just start robbing people if i only buy some magazine subscriptions from them so normally i just ignore the doorbell but on this day i answered and there stood two boys each about 19 in white starched short sleeved shirts and they had little name tags that identified them as official representatives of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints and they said they had a message for me from god i said a message for me from god and they said yes now i was raised in the pacific northwest around a lot of church of latter day saints people and you know i ve worked with them and even dated them but i never really knew the doctrine or what they said to people when they were out on a mission and i guess i was sort of curious so i said well please come in and they looked really happy because i do n t think this happens to them all that often and i sat them down and i got them glasses of water ok i got it i got them glasses of water do n t touch my hair that s the thing you ca n t put a video of myself in front of me and expect me not to fix my hair ok so i sat them down and i got them glasses of water and after niceties they said do you believe that god loves you with all his heart and i thought well of course i believe in god but you know i do n t like that word heart because it anthropomorphizes god and i do n t like the word his either because that sexualizes god but i did n t want to argue semantics with these boys so after a very long uncomfortable pause i said yes yes i do i feel very loved and they looked at each other and smiled like that was the right answer and then they said do you believe that we re all brothers and sisters on this planet and i said yes i do yes i do and i was so relieved that it was a question i could answer so quickly and they said well then we have a story to tell you and they told me this story all about this guy named lehi who lived in jerusalem in 600 bc now apparently in jerusalem in 600 bc everyone was completely bad and evil every single one of them man woman child infant fetus and god came to lehi and said to him put your family on a boat and i will lead you out of here and god did lead them he led them to america i said america from jerusalem to america by boat in 600 bc and they said yes then they told me how lehi and his descendants reproduced and reproduced and over the course of 600 years there were two great races of them the nephites and the lamanites and the nephites were totally totally good each and every one of them and the lamanites were totally bad and evil every single one of them just bad to the bone then after jesus died on the cross for our sins on his way up to heaven he stopped by america and visited the nephites and he told them that if they all remained totally totally good each and every one of them they would win the war against the evil lamanites but apparently somebody blew it because the lamanites were able to kill all the nephites all but one guy this guy named mormon who managed to survive by hiding in the woods and he made sure this whole story was written down in reformed egyptian hieroglyphics chiseled onto gold plates which he then buried near palmyra new york well i was just on the edge of my seat i said what happened to the lamanites and they said well they became our native americans here in the u s and i said so you believe the native americans are descended from a people who were totally evil and they said yes then they told me how this guy named joseph smith found those buried gold plates right in his backyard and he also found this magic stone back there that he put into his hat and then buried his face into and this allowed him to translate the gold plates from the reformed egyptian into english well at this point i just wanted to give these two boys some advice about their pitch i wanted to say ok do n t start with this story i mean even the scientologists know to start with a personality test before they start telling people all about xenu the evil intergalactic overlord well then they said do you believe that god speaks to us through his righteous prophets and i said no i do n t because i was sort of upset about this lamanite story and this crazy gold plate story but the truth was i had n t really thought this through so i backpedaled a little and i said well what exactly do you mean by righteous and what do you mean by prophets like could the prophets be women and they said no and i said why and they said well it s because god gave women a gift that is so spectacular it is so wonderful that the only gift he had left over to give men was the gift of prophecy what is this wonderful gift god gave women i wondered maybe their greater ability to cooperate and adapt women s longer lifespan the fact that women tend to be much less violent than men but no it was n t any of these gifts they said well it s her ability to bear children i said oh come on i mean even if women tried to have a baby every single year from the time they were 15 to the time they were 45 assuming they did n t die from exhaustion it still seems like some women would have some time left over to hear the word of god and they said no well then they did n t look so fresh faced and cute to me any more but they had more to say they said well we also believe that if you re a mormon and if you re in good standing with the church when you die you get to go to heaven and be with your family for all eternity and i said oh dear that would n t be such a good incentive for me and they said oh hey well we also believe that when you go to heaven you get your body restored to you in its best original state like if you d lost a leg well you get it back or if you d gone blind you could see i said oh now i do n t have a uterus because i had cancer a few years ago so does this mean that if i went to heaven i would get my old uterus back and they said sure and i said i do n t want it back i m happy without it gosh what if you had a nose job and you liked it would god force you to get your old nose back well then they gave me this book of mormon and they told me to read this chapter and that chapter and they said they d come back some day and check in on me and i think i said something like please do n t hurry or maybe it was just please do n t and they were gone ok so i initially felt really superior to these boys and smug in my more conventional faith but then the more i thought about it the more i had to be honest with myself if someone came to my door and i was hearing catholic theology and dogma for the very first time and they said we believe that god impregnated a very young girl without the use of intercourse and the fact that she was a virgin is maniacally important to us and she had a baby and that s the son of god i mean i would think that s equally ridiculous i m just so used to that story so i could n t let myself feel condescending towards these boys but the question they asked me when they first arrived really stuck in my head did i believe that god loved me with all his heart because i was n t exactly sure how i felt about that question now if they d asked me do you feel that god loves you with all his heart well that would have been much different i think i would have instantly answered yes yes i feel it all the time i feel god s love when i m hurt and confused and i feel consoled and cared for i take shelter in god s love when i do n t understand why tragedy hits and i feel god s love when i look with gratitude at all the beauty i see but since they asked me that question with the word believe in it somehow it was all different because i was n t exactly sure if i believed what i so clearly felt
