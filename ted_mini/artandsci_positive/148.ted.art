this is a recent comic strip from the los angeles times the punch line on the other hand i do n t have to get up at four every single morning to milk my labrador this is a recent cover of new york magazine best hospitals where doctors say they would go for cancer treatment births strokes heart disease hip replacements 4 a m emergencies and this is a song medley i put together did you ever notice that four in the morning has become some sort of meme or shorthand it means something like you are awake at the worst possible hour a time for inconveniences mishaps yearnings a time for plotting to whack the chief of police like in this classic scene from the godfather coppola s script describes these guys as exhausted in shirt sleeves it is four in the morning a time for even grimmer stuff than that like autopsies and embalmings in isabel allende s the house of the spirits after the breathtaking green haired rosa is murdered the doctors preserve her with unguents and morticians paste they worked until four o clock in the morning a time for even grimmer stuff than that like in last april s new yorker magazine this short fiction piece by martin amis starts out on september 11 2001 he opened his eyes at 4 a m in portland maine and mohamed atta s last day began for a time that i find to be the most placid and uneventful hour of the day four in the morning sure gets an awful lot of bad press across a lot of different media from a lot of big names and it made me suspicious i figured surely some of the most creative artistic minds in the world really are n t all defaulting back to this one easy trope like they invented it right could it be there is something more going on here something deliberate something secret and who got the four in the morning bad rap ball rolling anyway i say this guy alberto giacometti shown here with some of his sculptures on the swiss 100 franc note he did it with this famous piece from the new york museum of modern art its title the palace at four in the morning 1932 not just the earliest cryptic reference to four in the morning i can find i believe that this so called first surrealist sculpture may provide an incredible key to virtually every artistic depiction of four in the morning to follow it i call this the giacometti code a ted exclusive no feel free to follow along on your blackberries or your iphones if you ve got them it works a little something like this is a recent google search for four in the morning results vary of course this is pretty typical the top 10 results yield you four hits for faron young s song it s four in the morning three hits for judi dench s film four in the morning one hit for wislawa szymborska s poem four in the morning but what you may ask do a polish poet a british dame a country music hall of famer all have in common besides this totally excellent google ranking well let s start with faron young who was born incidentally in 1932 in 1996 he shot himself in the head on december ninth which incidentally is judi dench s birthday but he did n t die on dench s birthday he languished until the following afternoon when he finally succumbed to a supposedly self inflicted gunshot wound at the age of 64 which incidentally is how old alberto giacometti was when he died where was wislawa szymborska during all this she has the world s most absolutely watertight alibi on that very day december 10 1996 while mr four in the morning faron young was giving up the ghost in nashville tennessee ms four in the morning or one of them anyway wislawa szymborska was in stockholm sweden accepting the nobel prize for literature 100 years to the day after the death of alfred nobel himself coincidence no it s creepy coincidence to me has a much simpler metric that s like me telling you hey you know the nobel prize was established in 1901 which coincidentally is the same year alberto giacometti was born no not everything fits so tidily into the paradigm but that does not mean there s not something going on at the highest possible levels in fact there are people in this room who may not want me to show you this clip we re about to see video homer simpson we have a tennis court a swimming pool a screening room you mean if i want pork chops even in the middle of the night your guy will fry them up herbert powell sure that s what he s paid for now do you need towels laundry maids hs wait wait wait wait wait wait let me see if i got this straight it is christmas day 4 a m there s a rumble in my stomach marge simpson homer please rives wait wait wait wait wait wait wait let me see if i got this straight matt when homer simpson needs to imagine the most remote possible moment of not just the clock but the whole freaking calendar he comes up with 0400 on the birthday of the baby jesus and no i do n t know how it works into the whole puzzling scheme of things but obviously i know a coded message when i see one i said i know a coded message when i see one and folks you can buy a copy of bill clinton s my life from the bookstore here at ted parse it cover to cover for whatever hidden references you want or you can go to the random house website where there is this excerpt and how far down into it you figure we ll have to scroll to get to the golden ticket would you believe about a dozen paragraphs this is page 474 on your paperbacks if you re following along though it was getting better i still was n t satisfied with the inaugural address my speechwriters must have been tearing their hair out because as we worked between one and four in the morning on inauguration day i was still changing it sure you were because you ve prepared your entire life for this historic quadrennial event that just sort of sneaks up on you and then three paragraphs later we get this little beauty we went back to blair house to look at the speech for the last time it had gotten a lot better since 4 a m well how could it have by his own writing this man was either asleep at a prayer meeting with al and tipper or learning how to launch a nuclear missile out of a suitcase what happens to american presidents at 0400 on inauguration day what happened to william jefferson clinton we might not ever know and i noticed he s not exactly around here today to face any tough questions it could get awkward right i mean after all this whole business happened on his watch but if he were here he might remind us as he does in the wrap up to his fine autobiography that on this day bill clinton began a journey a journey that saw him go on to become the first democrat president elected to two consecutive terms in decades in generations the first since this man franklin delano roosevelt who began his own unprecedented journey way back at his own first election way back in a simpler time way back in 1932 the year alberto giacometti made the palace at four in the morning the year let s remember that this voice now departed first came a cryin into this big old crazy world of ours
