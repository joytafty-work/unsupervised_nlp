hi everyone i m sirena i m 11 years old and from connecticut well i m not really sure why i m here i mean what does this have to do with technology entertainment and design well i count my ipod cellphone and computer as technology but this has nothing to do with that so i did a little research on it well this is what i found of course i hope i can memorize it the violin is basically made of a wood box and four main strings by playing the string the string vibrates and produces a sound wave sound passes through a piece of wood called a bridge and goes down to the wood box and gets amplified but let me think okay on the other hand by placing your finger in a different position on the fingerboard it changes the string length that changes the frequency of the sound wave oh my gosh okay this is sort of a technology but i can call it a 16th century technology but actually the most fascinating thing that i found was that even the audio system or wave transmission nowadays are still basically based on the same principle of producing and projecting sound is n t that cool design i love its design i remember when i was little my mom asked me would you like to play the violin or the piano i looked at that giant monster and said to myself i am not going to lock myself on that bench the whole day this is small and lightweight i can play from standing sitting or walking and you know what the best of all is that if i do n t want to practice i can hide it the violin is very beautiful some people relate it as the shape of a lady but whether you like it or not it s been so for more than 400 years unlike modern stuff that easily looks dated but i think it s very personal and unique that although each violin looks pretty similar that no two violins sound the same even from the same maker or based on the same model entertainment i love the entertainment but actually the instrument itself is n t very entertaining i mean when i first got my violin and tried to play around it was actually really bad because it did n t sound like the way i d heard from other kids so horrible and so scratchy so it was n t entertaining at all but besides my brother found this very funny yuk yuk yuk a few years later i heard a joke about the greatest violinist jascha heifetz after mr heifetz s concert a lady came over and complimented oh mr heifetz your violin sounded so great tonight and mr heifetz was a very cool person so he picked up his violin and said funny i do n t hear anything and now i realize that as the musician we human beings we have a great mind artistic heart and skill that can change the 16th century technology and a legendary design to a wonderful entertainment now i know why i m here at first i thought i was just going to be here to perform but unexpectedly i learned and enjoyed much more but although some of them were quite up there for me like the multi dimension stuff i mean honestly i d be happy enough if i can actually get my two dimension correct in school but actually the most impressive thing to me is that well actually i would also like to stand this for all children is to say thank you to all adults for actually caring for us a lot and to make our future world much better thank you
