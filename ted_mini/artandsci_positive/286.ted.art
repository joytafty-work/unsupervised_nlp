probably a lot of you know the story of the two salesmen who went down to africa in the 1900s they were sent down to find if there was any opportunity for selling shoes and they wrote telegrams back to manchester and one of them wrote situation hopeless stop they do n t wear shoes and the other one wrote glorious opportunity they do n t have any shoes yet now there s a similar situation in the classical music world because there are some people who think that classical music is dying and there are some of us who think you ai n t seen nothing yet and rather than go into statistics and trends and tell you about all the orchestras that are closing and the record companies that are folding i thought we should do an experiment tonight an experiment actually it s not really an experiment because i know the outcome but it s like an experiment now before we before we start i need to do two things one is i want to remind you of what a seven year old child sounds like when he plays the piano maybe you have this child at home he sounds something like this i see some of you recognize this child now if he practices for a year and takes lessons he s now eight and he sounds like this then he practices for another year and takes lessons now he s nine then he practices for another and takes lessons now he s 10 at that point they usually give up now if you d waited if you d waited for one more year you would have heard this now what happened was not maybe what you thought which is he suddenly became passionate engaged involved got a new teacher he hit puberty or whatever it is what actually happened was the impulses were reduced you see the first time he was playing with an impulse on every note and the second with an impulse every other note you can see it by looking at my head the nine year old put an impulse on every four notes and the 10 year old on every eight notes and the 11 year old one impulse on the whole phrase i know i do n t know how we got into this position i did n t say i m going to move my shoulder over move my body no the music pushed me over which is why i call it one buttock playing it can be the other buttock you know a gentleman was once watching a presentation i was doing when i was working with a young pianist he was the president of a corporation in ohio and i was working with this young pianist and i said the trouble with you is you re a two buttock player you should be a one buttock player and i moved his body like that while he was playing and suddenly the music took off it took flight there was a gasp in the audience when they heard the difference and then i got a letter from this gentleman he said i was so moved i went back and i transformed my entire company into a one buttock company now the other thing i wanted to do is to tell you about you there are 1 600 people i believe my estimation is that probably 45 of you are absolutely passionate about classical music you adore classical music your fm is always on that classical dial and you have cds in your car and you go to the symphony and your children are playing instruments you ca n t imagine your life without classical music that s the first group it s quite a small group then there s another group bigger group these are the people who do n t mind classical music you know you ve come home from a long day and you take a glass of wine and you put your feet up a little vivaldi in the background does n t do any harm that s the second group now comes the third group these are the people who never listen to classical music it s just simply not part of your life you might hear it like second hand smoke at the airport but and maybe a little bit of a march from aida when you come into the hall but otherwise you never hear it that s probably the largest group of all and then there s a very small group these are the people who think they re tone deaf amazing number of people think they re tone deaf actually i hear a lot my husband is tone deaf actually you cannot be tone deaf nobody is tone deaf if you were tone deaf you could n t change the gears on your car in a stick shift car you could n t tell the difference between somebody from texas and somebody from rome and the telephone the telephone if your mother calls on the miserable telephone she calls and says hello you not only know who it is you know what mood she s in you have a fantastic ear everybody has a fantastic ear so nobody is tone deaf but i tell you what it does n t work for me to go on with this thing with such a wide gulf between those who understand love and are passionate about classical music and those who have no relationship to it at all the tone deaf people they re no longer here but even between those three categories it s too wide a gulf so i m not going to go on until every single person in this room downstairs and in aspen and everybody else looking will come to love and understand classical music so that s what we re going to do now you notice that there is not the slightest doubt in my mind that this is going to work if you look at my face right it s one of the characteristics of a leader that he not doubt for one moment the capacity of the people he s leading to realize whatever he s dreaming imagine if martin luther king had said i have a dream of course i m not sure they ll be up to it all right so i m going to take a piece of chopin this is a beautiful prelude by chopin some of you will know it do you know what i think probably happened in this room when i started you thought how beautiful that sounds i do n t think we should go to the same place for our summer holidays next year it s funny is n t it it s funny how those thoughts kind of waft into your head and of course and of course if the piece is long and you ve had a long day you might actually drift off then your companion will dig you in the ribs and say wake up it s culture and then you feel even worse but has it ever occurred to you that the reason you feel sleepy in classical music is not because of you but because of us did anybody think while i was playing why is he using so many impulses if i d done this with my head you certainly would have thought it and for the rest of your life every time you hear classical music you ll always be able to know if you hear those impulses so let s see what s really going on here we have a b this is a b the next note is a c and the job of the c is to make the b sad and it does does n t it composers know that if they want sad music they just play those two notes but basically it s just a b with four sads now it goes down to a now to g and then to f so we have b a g f and if we have b a g f what do we expect next oh that might have been a fluke let s try it again ooh the ted choir and you notice nobody is tone deaf right nobody is you know every village in bangladesh and every hamlet in china everybody knows da da da da da everybody knows who s expecting that e now chopin did n t want to reach the e there because what will have happened it will be over like hamlet do you remember hamlet act one scene three he finds out that his uncle killed his father you remember he keeps on going up to his uncle and almost killing him and then he backs away and he goes up to him again and almost kills him and the critics all of whom are sitting in the back row there they have to have an opinion so they say hamlet is a procrastinator or they say hamlet has an oedipus complex no otherwise the play would be over stupid that s why shakespeare puts all that stuff in hamlet you know ophelia going mad and the play within the play and yorick s skull and the gravediggers that s in order to delay until act five he can kill him it s the same with the chopin he s just about to reach the e and he says oops better go back up and do it again so he does it again now he gets excited that s excitement you do n t have to worry about it now he gets to f sharp and finally he goes down to e but it s the wrong chord because the chord he s looking for is this one and instead he does now we call that a deceptive cadence because it deceives us i always tell my students if you have a deceptive cadence be sure to raise your eyebrows then everybody will know right so he gets to e but it s the wrong chord now he tries e again that chord does n t work now he tries the e again that chord does n t work now he tries e again and that does n t work and then finally there was a gentleman in the front row who went mmm it s the same gesture he makes when he comes home after a long day turns off the key in his car and says aah i m home because we all know where home is so this is a piece which goes from away to home and i m going to play it all the way through and you re going to follow b c b c b c b down to a down to g down to f almost goes to e but otherwise the play would be over he goes back up to b he gets very excited goes to f sharp goes to e it s the wrong chord it s the wrong chord it s the wrong chord and finally goes to e and it s home and what you re going to see is one buttock playing because for me to join the b to the e i have to stop thinking about every single note along the way and start thinking about the long long line from b to e you know we were just in south africa and you ca n t go to south africa without thinking of mandela in jail for 27 years what was he thinking about lunch no he was thinking about the vision for south africa and for human beings that s what kept this is about vision this is about the long line like the bird who flies over the field and does n t care about the fences underneath all right so now you re going to follow the line all the way from b to e and i ve one last request before i play this piece all the way through would you think of somebody who you adore who s no longer there a beloved grandmother a lover somebody in your life who you love with all your heart but that person is no longer with you bring that person into your mind and at the same time follow the line all the way from b to e and you ll hear everything that chopin had to say now you may be wondering you may be wondering why i m clapping well i did this at a school in boston with about 70 seventh graders 12 year olds and i did exactly what i did with you and i told them and explained them and the whole thing and at the end they went crazy clapping they were clapping i was clapping they were clapping finally i said why am i clapping and one of the little kids said because we were listening think of it 1 600 people busy people involved in all sorts of different things listening understanding and being moved by a piece by chopin now that is something now am i sure that every single person followed that understood it was moved by it of course i ca n t be sure but i tell you what happened to me i was in ireland during the troubles 10 years ago and i was working with some catholic and protestant kids on conflict resolution and i did this with them a risky thing to do because they were street kids and one of them came to me the next morning and he said you know i ve never listened to classical music in my life but when you played that shopping piece he said my brother was shot last year and i did n t cry for him but last night when you played that piece he was the one i was thinking about and i felt the tears streaming down my face and you know it felt really good to cry for my brother so i made up my mind at that moment that classical music is for everybody everybody now how would you walk because you know my profession the music profession does n t see it that way they say three percent of the population likes classical music if only we could move it to four percent our problems would be over i say how would you walk how would you talk how would you be if you thought three percent of the population likes classical music if only we could move it to four percent how would you walk how would you talk how would you be if you thought everybody loves classical music they just have n t found out about it yet see these are totally different worlds now i had an amazing experience i was 45 years old i d been conducting for 20 years and i suddenly had a realization the conductor of an orchestra does n t make a sound my picture appears on the front of the cd but the conductor does n t make a sound he depends for his power on his ability to make other people powerful and that changed everything for me it was totally life changing people in my orchestra came up to me and said ben what happened that s what happened i realized my job was to awaken possibility in other people and of course i wanted to know whether i was doing that and you know how you find out you look at their eyes if their eyes are shining you know you re doing it you could light up a village with this guy s eyes right so if the eyes are shining you know you re doing it if the eyes are not shining you get to ask a question and this is the question who am i being that my players eyes are not shining we can do that with our children too who am i being that my children s eyes are not shining that s a totally different world now we re all about to end this magical on the mountain week and we re going back into the world and i say it s appropriate for us to ask the question who are we being as we go back out into the world and you know i have a definition of success for me it s very simple it s not about wealth and fame and power it s about how many shining eyes i have around me so now i have one last thought which is that it really makes a difference what we say the words that come out of our mouth i learned this from a woman who survived auschwitz one of the rare survivors she went to auschwitz when she was 15 years old and her brother was eight and the parents were lost and she told me this she said we were in the train going to auschwitz and i looked down and saw my brother s shoes were missing and i said why are you so stupid ca n t you keep your things together for goodness sake the way an elder sister might speak to a younger brother unfortunately it was the last thing she ever said to him because she never saw him again he did not survive and so when she came out of auschwitz she made a vow she told me this she said i walked out of auschwitz into life and i made a vow and the vow was i will never say anything that could n t stand as the last thing i ever say now can we do that no and we ll make ourselves wrong and others wrong but it is a possibility to live into thank you shining eyes shining eyes thank you thank you
