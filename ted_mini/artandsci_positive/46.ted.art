thank you thank you very much like the speaker before me i am that s the ted virgin i guess i m also the first time here and i do n t know what to say i m really happy that mr anderson invited me i m really grateful that i get a chance to play for everyone and the song that i just played was by j zef hofmann it s called kaleidoscope and hofmann is a polish pianist and composer of the late 19th century and he s widely considered one of the greatest pianists of all time i have another piece that i d like to play for you it s called abegg variations by robert schumann a german 19th century composer the name abegg abegg is actually a b e g g and that s the main theme in the melody that comes from the last name of one of schumann s female friends but he wrote that for his wife so actually if you listen carefully there s supposed to be five variations on this abegg theme it s written around 1834 so even though it s old i hope you like it now comes the part that i hate well because mr anderson told me that this session is called sync and flow i was wondering what do i know that these geniuses do n t so i ll talk about musical composition even though i do n t know where to start how do i compose i think yamaha does a really good job of teaching us how to compose what i do first is i make a lot of little musical ideas you can just improvise here at the piano and i choose one of those to become my main theme my main melody like the abegg that you just heard and once i choose my main theme i have to decide out of all the styles in music what kind of style do i want and this year i composed a romantic style so for inspiration i listened to liszt and tchaikovsky and all the great romantic composers next i make the structure of the entire piece with my teachers they help me plan out the whole piece and then the hard part is filling it in with musical ideas because then you have to think and then when the piece takes somewhat of a solified form solidified excuse me solidified form you re supposed to actually polish the piece polish the details and then polish the overall performance of the composition and another thing that i enjoy doing is drawing drawing because i like to draw you know japanese anime art i think that s a craze among teens right now and once i realized it there s a parallel between creating music and creating art because for your motive or your little initial idea for your drawing it s your character you want to decide who do you want to draw or if you want to draw an original character and then you want to decide how are you going to draw the character like am i going to use one page am i going to draw it on the computer am i going to use a two page spread like a comic book for more grandiose effect i guess and then you have to do the initial sketch of the character which is like your structure of a piece and then you add pen and pencil and whatever details that you need that s polishing the drawing and another thing that both of these have in common is your state of mind because i do n t i m one of those teenagers that are really easily distracted so if i m trying to do homework if i m trying to do homework and i do n t feel like it i ll try to draw or you know waste my time and then what happens is sometimes i absolutely ca n t draw or i ca n t compose at all and then it s like there s too much on your mind you ca n t focus on what you re supposed to do and sometimes if you manage to use your time wisely and work on it you ll get something out of it but it does n t come naturally what happens is if something magical happens if something natural happens to you you re able to produce all this beautiful stuff instantly and then that s what i consider flow because that s when everything clicks and you re able to do anything you feel like you re on top of your game and you can do anything you want i m not going to play my own composition today because although i did finish it it s way too long instead i d like to try something called improvisation i have here seven note cards one with each note of the musical alphabet and i d like someone to come up here and choose five anyone to come up here and choose five and then i can make it into some sort of melody and i ll improvise it wow a volunteer yay nice to meet you goldie hawn thank you choose five jennifer lin yes five cards any five cards gh ok one two three oh d and f too familiar jl one more gh ok e for effort jl would you mind reading them out in the order that you chose them gh ok c g b a and e jl thank you very much gh you re welcome and what about these jl i wo n t use them thank you now she chose c g b a e i m going to try to put that in some sort of order ok that s nice so i m going to have a moment to think and i ll try to make something out of it the next song or the encore that i m going to play is called bumble boogie by jack fina
