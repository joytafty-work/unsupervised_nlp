i m not quite sure whether i really want to see a snare drum at nine o clock or so in the morning but anyway it s just great to see such a full theater and really i must thank herbie hancock and his colleagues for such a great presentation one of the interesting things of course is the combination of that raw hand on the instrument and technology and of course what he said about listening to our young people of course my job is all about listening and my aim really is to teach the world to listen that s my only real aim in life and it sounds quite simple but actually it s quite a big big job because you know when you look at a piece of music for example if i just open my little motorbike bag we have here hopefully a piece of music that is full of little black dots on the page and you know we open it up and i read the music so technically i can actually read this i will follow the instructions the tempo markings the dynamics i will do exactly as i m told and so therefore because time is short if i just play you literally the first maybe two lines or so it s very straightforward there s nothing too difficult about the piece but here i m being told that the piece of music is very quick i m being told where to play on the drum i m being told which part of the stick to use and i m being told the dynamic and i m also being told that the drum is without snares snares on snares off so therefore if i translate this piece of music we have this idea and so on my career would probably last about five years however what i have to do as a musician is do everything that is not on the music everything that there is n t time to learn from a teacher or to talk about even from a teacher but it s the things that you notice when you re not actually with your instrument that in fact become so interesting and that you want to explore through this tiny tiny surface of a drum so there we experience the translation now we ll experience the interpretation now my career may last a little longer but in a way you know it s the same if i look at you and i see a nice bright young lady with a pink top on i see that you re clutching a teddy bear etc etc so i get a basic idea as to what you might be about what you might like what you might do as a profession etc etc however that s just you know the initial idea i may have that we all get when we actually look and we try to interpret but actually it s so unbelievably shallow in the same way i look at the music i get a basic idea i wonder what technically might be hard or you know what i want to do just the basic feeling however that is simply not enough and i think what herbie said please listen listen we have to listen to ourselves first of all if i play for example holding the stick where literally i do not let go of the stick you ll experience quite a lot of shock coming up through the arm and you feel really quite believe it or not detached from the instrument and from the stick even though i m actually holding the stick quite tightly by holding it tightly i feel strangely more detached if i just simply let go and allow my hand my arm to be more of a support system suddenly i have more dynamic with less effort much more and i just feel at last one with the stick and one with the drum and i m doing far far less so in the same way that i need time with this instrument i need time with people in order to interpret them not just translate them but interpret them if for example i play just a few bars of a piece of music for which i think of myself as a technician that is someone who is basically a percussion player and so on if i think of myself as a musician and so on there is a little bit of a difference there that is worth just thinking about and i remember when i was 12 years old and i started playing tympani and percussion and my teacher said well how are we going to do this you know music is about listening and i said yes i agree with that so what s the problem and he said well how are you going to hear this how are you going to hear that and i said well how do you hear it he said well i think i hear it through here and i said well i think i do too but i also hear it through my hands through my arms cheekbones my scalp my tummy my chest my legs and so on and so we began our lessons every single time tuning drums in particular the kettle drums or tympani to such a narrow pitch interval so something like that of a difference then gradually and gradually and it s amazing that when you do open your body up and open your hand up to allow the vibration to come through that in fact the tiny tiny difference can be felt with just the tiniest part of your finger there and so what we would do is that i would put my hands on the wall of the music room and together we would listen to the sounds of the instruments and really try to connect with those sounds far far more broadly than simply depending on the ear because of course the ear is i mean subject to all sorts of things the room we happen to be in the amplification the quality of the instrument the type of sticks etc etc they re all different same amount of weight but different sound colors and that s basically what we are we re just human beings but we all have our own little sound colors as it were that make up these extraordinary personalities and characters and interests and things and as i grew older i then auditioned for the royal academy of music in london and they said well no we wo n t accept you because we have n t a clue you know of the future of a so called deaf musician and i just could n t quite accept that and so therefore i said to them well look if you refuse if you refuse me through those reasons as opposed to the ability to perform and to understand and love the art of creating sound then we have to think very very hard about the people you do actually accept and as a result once we got over a little hurdle and having to audition twice they accepted me and not only that what had happened was that it changed the whole role of the music institutions throughout the united kingdom under no circumstances were they to refuse any application whatsoever on the basis of whether someone had no arms no legs they could still perhaps play a wind instrument if it was supported on a stand no circumstances at all were used to refuse any entry and every single entry had to be listened to experienced and then based on the musical ability then that person could either enter or not so therefore this in turn meant that there was an extremely interesting bunch of students who arrived in these various music institutions and i have to say many of them now in the professional orchestras throughout the world the interesting thing about this as well though is quite simply that not only were people connected with sound which is basically all of us and we well know that music really is our daily medicine i say music but actually i mean sound because you know some of the extraordinary things i ve experienced as a musician when you may have a 15 year old lad who has got the most incredible challenges who may not be able to control his movements who may be deaf who may be blind etc etc suddenly if that young lad sits close to this instrument and perhaps even lies underneath the marimba and you play something that s so incredibly organ like almost i do n t really have the right sticks perhaps but something like this let me change something that s so unbelievably simple but he would be experiencing something that i would n t be because i m on top of the sound i have the sound coming this way he would have the sound coming through the resonators if there were no resonators on here we would have so he would have a fullness of sound that those of you in the front few rows would n t experience those of you in the back few rows would n t experience either every single one of us depending on where we re sitting will experience this sound quite quite differently and of course being the participator of the sound and that is starting from the idea of what type of sound i want to produce for example this sound can you hear anything exactly because i m not even touching it but yet we get the sensation of something happening in the same way that when i see tree moves then i imagine that tree making a rustling sound do you see what i mean whatever the eye sees then there s always sound happening so there s always always that huge i mean just this kaleidoscope of things to draw from so all of my performances are based on entirely what i experience and not by learning a piece of music putting on someone else s interpretation of it buying all the cds possible of that particular piece of music and so on and so forth because that is n t giving me enough of something that is so raw and so basic and something that i can fully experience the journey of so it may be that in certain halls this dynamic may well work it may be that in other halls they re simply not going to experience that at all and so therefore my level of soft gentle playing may have to be do you see what i mean so because of this explosion in access to sound especially through the deaf community this has not only affected how music institutions how schools for the deaf treat sound and not just as a means of therapy although of course being a participator of music that definitely is the case as well but it s meant that acousticians have had to really think about the types of halls they put together there are so few halls in this world that actually have very good acoustics dare i say but by that i mean where you can absolutely do anything you imagine the tiniest softest softest sound to something that is so broad so huge so incredible there s always something it may sound good up there may not be so good there may be great there but terrible up there maybe terrible over there but not too bad there etc etc so to find an actual hall is incredible for which you can play exactly what you imagine without it being cosmetically enhanced and so therefore acousticians are actually in conversation with people who are hearing impaired and who are participators of sound and this is quite interesting i cannot you know give you any detail as far as what is actually happening with those halls but it s just the fact that they are going to a group of people for whom so many years we ve been saying well how on earth can they experience music you know they re deaf we just we go like that and we imagine that that s what deafness is about or we go like that and we imagine that s what blindness is about if we see someone in a wheelchair we assume they cannot walk it may be that they can walk three four five steps that to them means they can walk in a year s time it could be two extra steps in another year s time three extra steps those are hugely important aspects to think about so when we do listen to each other it s unbelievably important for us to really test our listening skills to really use our bodies as a resonating chamber to stop the judgment for me as a musician who deals with 99 percent of new music it s very easy for me to say oh yes i like that piece oh no i do n t like that piece and so on and you know i just find that i have to give those pieces of music real time it may be that the chemistry is n t quite right between myself and that particular piece of music but that does n t mean i have the right to say it s a bad piece of music and you know it s just one of the great things about being a musician is that it is so unbelievably fluid so there are no rules no right no wrong this way that way if i asked you to clap maybe i can do this if i can just say please clap and create the sound of thunder i m assuming we ve all experienced thunder now i do n t mean just the sound i mean really listen to that thunder within yourselves and please try to create that through your clapping try just please try very good snow snow have you ever heard snow audience no evelyn glennie well then stop clapping try again try again snow see you re awake rain not bad not bad you know the interesting thing here though is that i asked a group of kids not so long ago exactly the same question now great imagination thank you very much however not one of you got out of your seats to think right how can i clap ok maybe maybe i can use my jewelry to create extra sounds maybe i can use the other parts of my body to create extra sounds not a single one of you thought about clapping in a slightly different way other than sitting in your seats there and using two hands in the same way that when we listen to music we assume that it s all being fed through here this is how we experience music of course it s not we experience thunder thunder thunder think think think listen listen listen now what can we do with thunder i remember my teacher when i first started my very first lesson i was all prepared with sticks ready to go and instead of him saying ok evelyn please feet slightly apart arms at a more or less 90 degree angle sticks in a more or less v shape keep this amount of space here etc please keep your back straight etc etc etc where i was probably just going to end up absolutely rigid frozen and i would not be able to strike the drum because i was thinking of so many other things he said evelyn take this drum away for seven days and i ll see you next week so heavens what was i to do i no longer required the sticks i was n t allowed to have these sticks i had to basically look at this particular drum see how it was made what these little lugs did what the snares did turned it upside down experimented with the shell experimented with the head experimented with my body experimented with jewelry experimented with all sorts of things and of course i returned with all sorts of bruises and things like that but nevertheless it was such an unbelievable experience because then where on earth are you going to experience that in a piece of music where on earth are you going to experience that in a study book so we never ever dealt with actual study books so for example one of the things that we learn when we are dealing with being a percussion player as opposed to a musician is basically straightforward single stroke rolls like that and then we get a little faster and a little faster and a little faster and so on and so forth what does this piece require single stroke rolls so why ca n t i then do that whilst learning a piece of music and that s exactly what he did and interestingly the older i became and when i became a full time student at a so called music institution all of that went out of the window we had to study from study books and constantly the question well why why what is this relating to i need to play a piece of music oh well this will help your control well how why do i need to learn that i need to relate it to a piece of music you know i need to say something why am i practicing paradiddles is it just literally for control for hand stick control why am i doing that i need to have the reason and the reason has to be by saying something through the music and by saying something through music which basically is sound we then can reach all sorts of things to all sorts of people but i do n t want to take responsibility of your emotional baggage that s up to you when you walk through a hall because that then determines what and how we listen to certain things i may feel sorrowful or happy or exhilarated or angry when i play certain pieces of music but i m not necessarily wanting you to feel exactly the same thing so please the next time you go to a concert just allow your body to open up allow your body to be this resonating chamber be aware that you re not going to experience the same thing as the performer is the performer is in the worst possible position for the actual sound because they re hearing the contact of the stick on the drum or the mallet on the bit of wood or the bow on the string etc or the breath that s creating the sound from wind and brass they re experiencing that rawness there but yet they re experiencing something so unbelievably pure which is before the sound is actually happening please take note of the life of the sound after the actual initial strike or breath is being pulled just experience the whole journey of that sound in the same way that i wished i d experienced the whole journey of this particular conference rather than just arriving last night but i hope maybe we can share one or two things as the day progresses but thank you very much for having me
