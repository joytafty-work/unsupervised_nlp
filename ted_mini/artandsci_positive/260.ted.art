i started juggling a long time ago but long before that i was a golfer and that s what i was a golfer and as a golfer and as a kid one of the things that really sort of seeped into my pores that i sort of lived my whole life is process and it s the process of learning things one of the great things was that my father was an avid golfer but he was lefty and he had a real passion for golf and he also created this whole mythology about ben hogan and various things well i learned a lot about interesting things that i knew nothing about at the time but grew to know stuff about and that was the mythology of skill so one of the things that i love to do is to explore skill and since richard put me on this whole thing with music i m supposed to actually be doing a project with tod machover with the mit media lab it relates a lot to music but tod could n t come and the project is sort of somewhere i m not sure whether it s happening the way we thought or not but i m going to explore skill and juggling and basically visual music i guess ok you can start the music thanks thanks thank you now juggling can be a lot of fun play with skill and play with space play with rhythm and you can turn the mike on now i m going to do a couple of pieces i do a big piece in a triangle and these are three sections from it part of the challenge was to try to understand rhythm and space using not just my hands because a lot of juggling is hand oriented but using the rhythm of my body and feet and controlling the balls with my feet thanks now this next section was an attempt to explore space you see i think richard said something about people that are against something well a lot of people think jugglers defy gravity or do stuff well i kind of from my childhood and golf and all that it s a process of joining with forces and so what i d like to do is try to figure out how to join with the space through the technique so juggling gravity up down if you figure out what up and down really are it s a complex physical set of skills to be able to throw a ball down and up and everything but then you add in sideways now i look at it somewhat as a way when you learn juggling what you learn is how to feel with your eyes and see with your hands because you re not looking at your hands you re looking at where the balls are or you re looking at the audience so this next part is really a way of understanding space and rhythm with the obvious reference to the feet but it s also time where the feet were where the balls were thanks so visual music rhythm and complexity i m going to build towards complexity now juggling three balls is simple and normal excuse me we re jugglers ok and remember you re transposing you re getting into a subculture here and juggling the balls cross and all that ok if you keep them in their assigned paths you get parallel lines of different heights but then hopefully even rhythm and you can change the rhythm good michael you can change the rhythm if you get out of the lights ok change the rhythm so it s even or you can go back and change the height now skill but you re boxed in if you can only do it up and down that way so you ve got to go after the space down there ok then you ve got to combine them because then you have the whole spatial palette in front of you and then you get crazy now i m actually going to ask you to try something so you ve got to pay attention complexity if you spend enough time doing something time slows down or your skill increases so your perceptions change it s learning skills like being in a high speed car crash things slow down as you learn as you learn as you learn you may not be able to affect it it almost drifts on you it goes but that s the closest approximation i can have to it so complexity now how many here are jugglers ok so most of you are going to have a similar reaction to this ok and whoever laughed there you understood it completely right no it looks like a mess it looks like a mess with a guy there who s got his hands around that mess ok well that s what juggling is about right it s being able to do something that other people ca n t do or ca n t understand all right so that s one way of doing it which is five balls down ok another way is the outside and you could play with the rhythm same pattern make it faster and smaller make it wider make it narrower bring it back up ok it s done thanks now what i wanted to get to is that you re all very bright very tactile i have no idea how computer oriented or three dimensionally oriented you are but let s try something ok so since you all do n t understand what the five ball pattern is i m going to give you a little clue enough of a clue so you get the pattern right ok you re not getting off that easy all right now do me a favor follow the ball that i ask you to follow green yellow pink white ok you can do that yeah ok now let s actually learn something actually let me put you in that area of learning which is very insecure you want to do it yeah ok hands out in front of you palms up together what you re going to learn is this ok so what i want you to do is just listen to me and do it index finger middle finger ring little little ring middle index and then open finger finger finger finger finger finger finger finger a little bit faster finger finger finger finger finger finger finger finger finger finger finger finger finger finger finger finger all right a lot of different learning processes going on in here one learning process that i see is this ok another learning process that i see is this ok so everybody take a deep breath in breath out ok now one more time and finger finger finger finger finger finger finger finger open finger finger finger finger finger finger finger finger ok shake your hands out now i assume a lot of you spend a lot of time at a computer ok so what you re doing is you re going la la la and you re getting this ok so that s exactly what i m going to ask you to do but in a slightly different way you re going to combine it so what i want you to do is fingers i ll tell you what to do with your fingers same thing but i want you to do is also with your eyes is follow the colored ball that i ask you to follow ok here we go so we re going to start off looking at the white ball and i m going to tell you which color and i m also going to tell you to go with your fingers ok so white ball and finger finger finger finger finger finger finger finger pink finger finger finger finger finger finger finger finger green finger finger finger finger yellow finger finger finger pink or finger pink finger finger finger finger finger finger finger all right how did you do well ok the reason i wanted you to do this is because that s actually what most people face throughout their lives a moment of learning a moment of challenge it s a moment that you ca n t make sense of why the hell should i learn this ok does it really have anything to do with anything in my life you know i ca n t decipher is it fun is it challenging am i supposed to cheat you know what are you supposed to do you ve got somebody up here who is the operative principle of doing that for his whole life ok trying to figure that stuff out but is it going to get you anywhere it s just a moment that s all it is a moment ok i m going to change the script for one second just let me do this i do n t need music for it talking about time in a moment there s a piece that i recently developed which was all about that a moment and what i do as a creative artist is i develop vocabularies or languages of moving objects what i ve done for you here i developed a lot of those tricks and i put the choreography together but they re not original techniques now i m going to start showing you some original techniques that come from the work that i ve developed ok so a moment how would you define a moment well as a juggler what i wanted to do was create something that was representational of a moment ahhh all right i m going to get on my knees and do it so a moment ok and then what i did as a juggler was say ok what can i do to make that something that is dependent on something else another dynamic so a moment another moment excuse me still getting there a moment that travels a moment no we ll try that again it separates and comes back together time how can you look at time and what do you dedicate it to in exploring a particular thing well obviously there s something in here and you can all have a guess as to what it is there s a mystery there s a mystery in the moment and it has to settle and then it s dependent on something else and then it comes to rest just a little thing about time now this has expanded into a much bigger piece because i use ramps of different parabolas that i roll the balls on while i m keeping time with this but i just thought i d talk about a moment all right ok can we show the video of the triangle are we ready to do that yes this is the piece that i told you about it s a much bigger piece that i do exploring the space of a geometric triangle thanks the only thing i ll say about the last session is you ever try juggling and driving the car with your knees at 120 miles an hour the only other thing is it was a real shock i always drove motorcycles and when i bought my first car it shocked me that it cost three times more than my parents house interesting anyway balance constant movement to find an approach to stillness balance making up the rules so you ca n t cheat so you learn to approach stillness with different parts of your body to have a conversation with it to speak to listen hup now it s dependent on rhythm and keeping a center of balance when it falls going underneath so there s a rhythm to it the rhythm can get much smaller as your skill increases you learn to find those tinier spaces those tinier movements thanks now i m going to show you the beginnings of a piece that is about balance in some ways and also oh actually if you re bored not here here s one use for it you can go with the sticks one music thanks that has a certain kind of balance to it which is all about plumb i apprenticed with a carpenter and learned about plumb square and level and they influenced that and this next piece which i ll do a little segment of two sticks you can go with it thanks which is again exploring space or the lines in space working with space and the lines in space in a different way oh let s see here so i ll come back to that in a second but working with one ball now what if you attach something to it or change it this is a little thing that i made because i really like the idea of curves and balls together and then creating space and the rhythm of space using the surface of the balls the surface of the arms just a little toy which leads me to the next thing which is what have i got here ok all right i m actually leading up to something the newest thing that i m working on this is not it this is exploring geometry and the rhythm of shape now what i just did was i worked with the mathematics the diameter and the circumference sometimes these pieces are mathematical in that way that i look at a shape and say what about if i use this and this and this sometimes what happens in life affects my choice of objects that i try to work with the next piece that i m going to do which is the cylinders piece if you want to get that up it has to do with cylinder seals from about 5 000 years ago which were stones with designs that were used to roll over wet clay with all sorts of great designs i love ceramics and all of that it s a combination of that the beauty of that the shape and the stories that were involved in it as well as the fact that they protected the contents the second influence on this piece came from recycling and looking into a tin can recycling bin and seeing all that beautiful emptiness so if you want to go with the music for cylinders talking about geometry and everything if you take the circle and you split it in half can you run s curve music i m going to do just a short version of it circles split in half and rotated and mythology anyway that piece also has a kinetic sculpture in the middle of it and i dance around a small stage so two minutes just to end the latest piece that i m working on what i love is that i never know what i m working on why i m working on it they re not ideas they re instincts and the latest thing that i m working on is something really i do n t know what it is yet and that s good i like not to know for as long as possible well because then it tells me the truth instead of me imposing the truth and what it is is working with both positive and negative space but also with these curves and what it involves and i do n t know if my hands are too beaten up to do it or not but i ll do a little bit of it it initially started off with me stacking these things bunches of them and then playing with the sense of space of filling in the space and then it started changing and become folding on themselves and then changing levels because my attempt is to make visual instruments not to just make i ll try one other thing for work in three dimensions with your perceptions of space and time now i do n t know exactly where it s going but i ve got a bit of effort involved in this thing and it s going to change as i go through it but i really like it it feels right this may not be the right shape and look at this shape and then i ll show you the first design i ever put to it just to see just to play because i love all different kinds of things to play with let s see here to work with the positive and negative in a different way and to change and to change so i m off in my new direction with this to explore rhythm and space we ll see what i come up with thanks for having me
