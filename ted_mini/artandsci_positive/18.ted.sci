it is a thrill to be here at a conference that s devoted to inspired by nature you can imagine and i m also thrilled to be in the foreplay section did you notice this section is foreplay because i get to talk about one of my favorite critters which is the western grebe you have n t lived until you ve seen these guys do their courtship dance i was on bowman lake in glacier national park which is a long skinny lake with sort of mountains upside down in it and my partner and i have a rowing shell and so we were rowing and one of these western grebes came along and what they do for their courtship dance is they go together the two of them the two mates and they begin to run underwater they paddle faster and faster and faster until they re going so fast that they literally lift up out of the water and they re standing upright sort of paddling the top of the water and one of these grebes came along while we were rowing and so we re in a skull and we re moving really really quickly and this grebe i think sort of mistaked us for a prospect and started to run along the water next to us in a courtship dance for miles it would stop and then start and then stop and then start now that is foreplay i came this close to changing species at that moment obviously life can teach us something in the entertainment section life has a lot to teach us but what i d like to talk about today is what life might teach us in technology and in design what s happened since the book came out the book was mainly about research in biomimicry and what s happened since then is architects designers engineers people who make our world have started to call and say we want a biologist to sit at the design table to help us in real time become inspired or and this is the fun part for me we want you to take us out into the natural world we ll come with a design challenge and we find the champion adapters in the natural world who might inspire us so this is a picture from a galapagos trip that we took with some wastewater treatment engineers they purify wastewater and some of them were very resistant actually to being there what they said to us at first was you know we already do biomimicry we use bacteria to clean our water and we said well that s not exactly being inspired by nature that s bioprocessing you know that s bio assisted technology using an organism to do your wastewater treatment is an old old technology called domestication this is learning something learning an idea from an organism and then applying it and so they still were n t getting it so we went for a walk on the beach and i said well give me one of your big problems give me a design challenge sustainability speed bump that s keeping you from being sustainable and they said scaling which is the build up of minerals inside of pipes and they said you know what happens is mineral just like at your house mineral builds up and then the aperture closes and we have to flush the pipes with toxins or we have to dig them up so if we had some way to stop this scaling and so i picked up some shells on the beach and i asked them what is scaling what s inside your pipes and they said calcium carbonate and i said that s what this is this is calcium carbonate and they did n t know that they did n t know that what a seashell is it s templated by proteins and then ions from the seawater crystallize in place to create a shell so the same sort of a process without the proteins is happening on the inside of their pipes they did n t know this is not for lack of information it s a lack of integration you know it s a silo people in silos they did n t know that the same thing was happening so one of them thought about it and said ok well if this is just crystallization that happens automatically out of seawater self assembly then why are n t shells infinite in size what stops the scaling why do n t they just keep on going and i said well in the same way that they exude a protein and it starts the crystallization and then they all sort of leaned in they let go of a protein that stops the crystallization it literally adheres to the growing face of the crystal and in fact there is a product called tpa that s mimicked that protein that stop protein and it s an environmentally friendly way to stop scaling in pipes that changed everything from then on you could not get these engineers back in the boat the first day they would take a hike and it was click click click click five minutes later they were back in the boat we re done you know i ve seen that island after this they were crawling all over they would snorkel for as long as we would let them snorkel what had happened was that they realized that there were organisms out there that had already solved the problems that they had spent their careers trying to solve learning about the natural world is one thing learning from the natural world that s the switch that s the profound switch what they realized was that the answers to their questions are everywhere they just needed to change the lenses with which they saw the world 3 8 billion years of field testing 10 to 30 craig venter will probably tell you i think there s a lot more than 30 million well adapted solutions the important thing for me is that these are solutions solved in context and the context is the earth the same context that we re trying to solve our problems in so it s the conscious emulation of life s genius it s not slavishly mimicking although al is trying to get the hairdo going it s not a slavish mimicry it s taking the design principles the genius of the natural world and learning something from it now in a group with so many it people i do have to mention what i m not going to talk about and that is that your field is one that has learned an enormous amount from living things on the software side so there s computers that protect themselves like an immune system and we re learning from gene regulation and biological development and we re learning from neural nets genetic algorithms evolutionary computing that s on the software side but what s interesting to me is that we have n t looked at this as much i mean these machines are really not very high tech in my estimation in the sense that there s dozens and dozens of carcinogens in the water in silicon valley so the hardware is not at all up to snuff in terms of what life would call a success so what can we learn about making not just computers but everything the plane you came in cars the seats that you re sitting on how do we redesign the world that we make the human made world more importantly what should we ask in the next 10 years and there s a lot of cool technologies out there that life has what s the syllabus three questions for me are key how does life make things this is the opposite this is how we make things it s called heat beat and treat that s what material scientists call it and it s carving things down from the top with 96 percent waste left over and only 4 percent product you heat it up you beat it with high pressures you use chemicals ok heat beat and treat life ca n t afford to do that how does life make things how does life make the most of things that s a geranium pollen and its shape is what gives it the function of being able to tumble through air so easily look at that shape life adds information to matter in other words structure it gives it information by adding information to matter it gives it a function that s different than without that structure and thirdly how does life make things disappear into systems because life does n t really deal in things there are no things in the natural world divorced from their systems really quick syllabus as i m reading more and more now and following the story there are some amazing things coming up in the biological sciences and at the same time i m listening to a lot of businesses and finding what their sort of grand challenges are the two groups are not talking to each other at all what in the world of biology might be helpful at this juncture to get us through this sort of evolutionary knothole that we re in i m going to try to go through 12 really quickly one that s exciting to me is self assembly now you ve heard about this in terms of nanotechnology back to that shell the shell is a self assembling material on the lower left there is a picture of mother of pearl forming out of seawater it s a layered structure that s mineral and then polymer and it makes it very very tough it s twice as tough as our high tech ceramics but what s really interesting unlike our ceramics that are in kilns it happens in seawater it happens near in and near the organism s body this is sandia national labs a guy named jeff brinker has found a way to have a self assembling coding process imagine being able to make ceramics at room temperature by simply dipping something into a liquid lifting it out of the liquid and having evaporation force the molecules in the liquid together so that they jigsaw together in the same way as this crystallization works imagine making all of our hard materials that way imagine spraying the precursors to a pv cell to a solar cell onto a roof and having it self assemble into a layered structure that harvests light here s an interesting one for the it world bio silicon this is a diatom which is made of silicates and so silicon which we make right now it s part of our carcinogenic problem in the manufacture of our chips this is a bio mineralization process that s now being mimicked this is at uc santa barbara look at these diatoms this is from ernst haeckel s work imagine being able to and again it s a templated process and it solidifies out of a liquid process imagine being able to have that sort of structure coming out at room temperature imagine being able to make perfect lenses on the left this is a brittle star it s covered with lenses that the people at lucent technologies have found have no distortion whatsoever it s one of the most distortion free lenses we know of and there s many of them all over its entire body what s interesting again is that it self assembles a woman named joanna aizenberg at lucent is now learning to do this in a low temperature process to create these sort of lenses she s also looking at fiber optics that s a sea sponge that has a fiber optic down at the very base of it there s fiber optics that work better than ours actually to move light but you can tie them in a knot they re incredibly flexible here s another big idea co 2 as a feedstock a guy named geoff coates at cornell said to himself you know plants do not see co 2 as the biggest poison of our time we see it that way plants are busy making long chains of starches and glucose right out of co 2 he s found a way he s found a catalyst and he s found a way to take co 2 and make it into polycarbonates biodegradable plastics out of co 2 how plant like solar transformations the most exciting one there are people who are mimicking the energy harvesting device inside of purple bacterium the people at asu even more interesting lately in the last couple of weeks people have seen that there s an enzyme called hydrogenase that s able to evolve hydrogen from proton and electrons and is able to take hydrogen up basically what s happening in a fuel cell in the anode of a fuel cell and in a reversible fuel cell in our fuel cells we do it with platinum life does it with a very very common iron and a team has now just been able to mimic that hydrogen juggling hydrogenase that s very exciting for fuel cells to be able to do that without platinum power of shape here s a whale we ve seen that the fins of this whale have tubercles on them and those little bumps actually increase efficiency in for instance the edge of an airplane increase efficiency by about 32 percent which is an amazing fossil fuel savings if we were to just put that on the edge of a wing color without pigments this peacock is creating color with shape light comes through it bounces back off the layers it s called thin film interference imagine being able to self assemble products with the last few layers playing with light to create color imagine being able to create a shape on the outside of a surface so that it s self cleaning with just water that s what a leaf does see that up close picture that s a ball of water and those are dirt particles and that s an up close picture of a lotus leaf there s a company making a product called lotusan which mimics when the building facade paint dries it mimics the bumps in a self cleaning leaf and rainwater cleans the building water is going to be our big grand challenge quenching thirst here are two organisms that pull water the one on the left is the namibian beetle pulling water out of fog the one on the right is a pill bug pulls water out of air does not drink fresh water pulling water out of monterey fog and out of the sweaty air in atlanta before it gets into a building are key technologies separation technologies are going to be extremely important what if we were to say no more hard rock mining what if we were to separate out metals from waste streams small amounts of metals in water that s what microbes do they chelate metals out of water there s a company here in san francisco called mr 3 that is embedding mimics of the microbes molecules on filters to mine waste streams green chemistry is chemistry in water we do chemistry in organic solvents this is a picture of the spinnerets coming out of a spider and the silk being formed from a spider is n t that beautiful green chemistry is replacing our industrial chemistry with nature s recipe book it s not easy because life uses only a subset of the elements in the periodic table and we use all of them even the toxic ones to figure out the elegant recipes that would take the small subset of the periodic table and create miracle materials like that cell is the task of green chemistry timed degradation packaging that is good until you do n t want it to be good anymore and dissolves on cue that s a mussel you can find in the waters out here and the threads holding it to a rock are timed at exactly two years they begin to dissolve healing this is a good one that little guy over there is a tardigrade there is a problem with vaccines around the world not getting to patients and the reason is that the refrigeration somehow gets broken what s called the cold chain gets broken a guy named bruce rosner looked at the tardigrade which dries out completely and yet stays alive for months and months and months and is able to regenerate itself and he found a way to dry out vaccines encase them in the same sort of sugar capsules as the tardigrade has within its cells meaning that vaccines no longer need to be refrigerated they can be put in a glove compartment ok learning from organisms this is a session about water learning about organisms that can do without water in order to create a vaccine that lasts and lasts and lasts without refrigeration i m not going to get to 12 but what i am going to do is tell you that the most important thing besides all of these adaptations is the fact that these organisms have figured out a way to do the amazing things they do while taking care of the place that s going to take care of their offspring when they re involved in foreplay they re thinking about something very very important and that s having their genetic material remain 10 000 generations from now and that means finding a way to do what they do without destroying the place that ll take care of their offspring that s the biggest design challenge luckily there are millions and millions of geniuses willing to gift us with their best ideas good luck having a conversation with them thank you chris anderson talk about foreplay i we need to get to 12 but really quickly janine benyus oh really ca yeah just like you know like the 10 second version of 10 11 and 12 because we just your slides are so gorgeous and the ideas are so big i ca n t stand to let you go down without seeing 10 11 and 12 jb ok put this ok i ll just hold this thing ok great ok so that s the healing one sensing and responding feedback is a huge thing this is a locust there can be 80 million of them in a square kilometer and yet they do n t collide with one another and yet we have 3 6 million car collisions a year right there s a person at newcastle who has figured out that it s a very large neuron and she s actually figuring out how to make a collision avoidance circuitry based on this very large neuron in the locust this is a huge and important one number 11 and that s the growing fertility that means you know net fertility farming we should be growing fertility and oh yes we get food too because we have to grow the capacity of this planet to create more and more opportunities for life and really that s what other organisms do as well in ensemble that s what whole ecosystems do they create more and more opportunities for life our farming has done the opposite so farming based on how a prairie builds soil ranching based on how a native ungulate herd actually increases the health of the range even wastewater treatment based on how a marsh not only cleans the water but creates incredibly sparkling productivity this is the simple design brief i mean it looks simple because the system over 3 8 billion years has worked this out that is those organisms that have not been able to figure out how to enhance or sweeten their places are not around to tell us about it that s the twelfth one life and this is the secret trick this is the magic trick life creates conditions conducive to life it builds soil it cleans air it cleans water it mixes the cocktail of gases that you and i need to live and it does that in the middle of having great foreplay and meeting their needs so it s not mutually exclusive we have to find a way to meet our needs while making of this place an eden ca janine thank you so much
