i m working a lot with motion and animation and also i m an old dj and a musician so music videos are something that i always found interesting but they always seem to be so reactive so i was thinking can you remove us as creators and try to make the music be the voice and have the animation following it so with two designers tolga and christina at my office we took a track many of you probably know it it s about 25 years old and it s david byrne and brian eno and we did this little animation and i think that it s maybe interesting also that it deals with two problematic issues which are rising waters and religion song before god destroyed the people on the earth he warned noah to build an ark and after noah built his ark i believe he told noah to warn the people that they must change all their wicked ways before he come upon them and destroy them and when noah had done built his ark i understand that somebody began to rend a song and the song began to move on i understand like this and when noah had done built his ark move on in fact concern so they get tired has come dark and rain they get weary and tired and then he went and knocked an old lady house and old lady ran to the door and say who is it jack say me mama san could we spend the night here because we re far from home we re very tired and the old lady said oh yes come on in it was come dark and rain will make you weary and tired
