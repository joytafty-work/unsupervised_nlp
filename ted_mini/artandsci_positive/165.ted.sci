so where are the robots we ve been told for 40 years already that they re coming soon very soon they ll be doing everything for us they ll be cooking cleaning buying things shopping building but they are n t here meanwhile we have illegal immigrants doing all the work but we do n t have any robots so what can we do about that what can we say so i want to give a little bit of a different perspective of how we can perhaps look at these things in a little bit of a different way and this is an x ray picture of a real beetle and a swiss watch back from 88 you look at that what was true then is certainly true today we can still make the pieces we can make the right pieces we can make the circuitry of the right computational power but we ca n t actually put them together to make something that will actually work and be as adaptive as these systems so let s try to look at it from a different perspective let s summon the best designer the mother of all designers let s see what evolution can do for us so we threw in we created a primordial soup with lots of pieces of robots with bars with motors with neurons put them all together and put all this under kind of natural selection under mutation and rewarded things for how well they can move forward a very simple task and it s interesting to see what kind of things came out of that so if you look you can see a lot of different machines come out of this they all move around they all crawl in different ways and you can see on the right that we actually made a couple of these things and they work in reality these are not very fantastic robots but they evolved to do exactly what we reward them for for moving forward so that was all done in simulation but we can also do that on a real machine here s a physical robot that we actually have a population of brains competing or evolving on the machine it s like a rodeo show they all get a ride on the machine and they get rewarded for how fast or how far they can make the machine move forward and you can see these robots are not ready to take over the world yet but they gradually learn how to move forward and they do this autonomously so in these two examples we had basically machines that learned how to walk in simulation and also machines that learned how to walk in reality but i want to show you a different approach and this is this robot over here which has four legs it has eight motors four on the knees and four on the hip it has also two tilt sensors that tell the machine which way it s tilting but this machine does n t know what it looks like you look at it and you see it has four legs the machine does n t know if it s a snake if it s a tree it does n t have any idea what it looks like but it s going to try to find that out initially it does some random motion and then it tries to figure out what it might look like and you re seeing a lot of things passing through its minds a lot of self models that try to explain the relationship between actuation and sensing it then tries to do a second action that creates the most disagreement among predictions of these alternative models like a scientist in a lab then it does that and tries to explain that and prune out its self models this is the last cycle and you can see it s pretty much figured out what its self looks like and once it has a self model it can use that to derive a pattern of locomotion so what you re seeing here are a couple of machines a pattern of locomotion we were hoping that it wass going to have a kind of evil spidery walk but instead it created this pretty lame way of moving forward but when you look at that you have to remember that this machine did not do any physical trials on how to move forward nor did it have a model of itself it kind of figured out what it looks like and how to move forward and then actually tried that out so we ll move forward to a different idea so that was what happened when we had a couple of that s what happened when you had a couple of ok ok ok they do n t like each other so there s a different robot that s what happened when the robots actually are rewarded for doing something what happens if you do n t reward them for anything you just throw them in so we have these cubes like the diagram showed here the cube can swivel or flip on its side and we just throw 1 000 of these cubes into a soup this is in simulation and do n t reward them for anything we just let them flip we pump energy into this and see what happens in a couple of mutations so initially nothing happens they re just flipping around there but after a very short while you can see these blue things on the right there begin to take over they begin to self replicate so in absence of any reward the intrinsic reward is self replication and we ve actually built a couple of these and this is part of a larger robot made out of these cubes it s an accelerated view where you can see the robot actually carrying out some of its replication process so you re feeding it with more material cubes in this case and more energy and it can make another robot so of course this is a very crude machine but we re working on a micro scale version of these and hopefully the cubes will be like a powder that you pour in ok so what can we learn these robots are of course not very useful in themselves but they might teach us something about how we can build better robots and perhaps how humans animals create self models and learn and one of the things that i think is important is that we have to get away from this idea of designing the machines manually but actually let them evolve and learn like children and perhaps that s the way we ll get there thank you
