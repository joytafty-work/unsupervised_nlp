i do two things i design mobile computers and i study brains and today s talk is about brains and yay somewhere i have a brain fan out there i m going to if i can have my first slide up here and you ll see the title of my talk and my two affiliations so what i m going to talk about is why we do n t have a good brain theory why it is important that we should develop one and what we can do about it and i ll try to do all that in 20 minutes i have two affiliations most of you know me from my palm and handspring days but i also run a nonprofit scientific research institute called the redwood neuroscience institute in menlo park and we study theoretical neuroscience and we study how the neocortex works i m going to talk all about that i have one slide on my other life the computer life and that s the slide here these are some of the products i ve worked on over the last 20 years starting back from the very original laptop to some of the first tablet computers and so on and ending up most recently with the treo and we re continuing to do this and i ve done this because i really believe that mobile computing is the future of personal computing and i m trying to make the world a little bit better by working on these things but this was i have to admit all an accident i really did n t want to do any of these products and very early in my career i decided i was not going to be in the computer industry and before i tell you about that i just have to tell you this one little picture of graffiti there i picked off the web the other day i was looking for a picture of graffiti little text input language and i found the website dedicated to teachers who want to make these you know the script writing things across the top of their blackboard and they had added graffiti to it and i m sorry about that so what happened was when i was young and got out of engineering school at cornell in 79 i decided i went to work for intel and i was in the computer industry and three months into that i fell in love with something else and i said i made the wrong career choice here and i fell in love with brains this is not a real brain this is a picture of one a line drawing but i do n t remember exactly how it happened but i have one recollection which was pretty strong in my mind in september 1979 scientific american came out with a single topic issue about the brain and it was quite good it was one of the best issues ever and they talked about the neuron and development and disease and vision and all the things you might want to know about brains it was really quite impressive and one might have the impression that we really knew a lot about brains but the last article in that issue was written by francis crick of dna fame today is i think the 50th anniversary of the discovery of dna and he wrote a story basically saying well this is all well and good but you know what we do n t know diddley squat about brains and no one has a clue how these things work so do n t believe what anyone tells you this is a quote from that article he said what is conspicuously lacking he s a very proper british gentleman so what is conspicuously lacking is a broad framework of ideas in which to interpret these different approaches i thought the word framework was great he did n t say we did n t even have a theory he says we do n t even know how to begin to think about it we do n t even have a framework we are in the pre paradigm days if you want to use thomas kuhn and so i fell in love with this and said look we have all this knowledge about brains how hard can it be and this is something we can work on my lifetime i felt i could make a difference and so i tried to get out of the computer business into the brain business first i went to mit the ai lab was there and i said well i want to build intelligent machines too but the way i want to do it is to study how brains work first and they said oh you do n t need to do that we re just going to program computers that s all we need to do and i said no you really ought to study brains they said oh you know you re wrong and i said no you re wrong and i did n t get in but i was a little disappointed pretty young but i went back again a few years later and this time was in california and i went to berkeley and i said i ll go in from the biological side so i got in in the ph d program in biophysics and i was all right i m studying brains now and i said well i want to study theory and they said oh no you ca n t study theory about brains that s not something you do you ca n t get funded for that and as a graduate student you ca n t do that so i said oh my gosh i was very depressed i said but i can make a difference in this field so what i did is i went back in the computer industry and said well i ll have to work here for a while do something that s when i designed all those computer products and i said i want to do this for four years make some money like i was having a family and i would mature a bit and maybe the business of neuroscience would mature a bit well it took longer than four years it s been about 16 years but i m doing it now and i m going to tell you about it so why should we have a good brain theory well there s lots of reasons people do science one is the most basic one is people like to know things we re curious and we just go out and get knowledge you know why do we study ants well it s interesting maybe we ll learn something really useful about it but it s interesting and fascinating but sometimes a science has some other attributes which makes it really really interesting sometimes a science will tell something about ourselves it ll tell us who we are rarely you know evolution did this and copernicus did this where we have a new understanding of who we are and after all we are our brains my brain is talking to your brain our bodies are hanging along for the ride but my brain is talking to your brain and if we want to understand who we are and how we feel and perceive we really understand what brains are another thing is sometimes science leads to really big societal benefits and technologies or businesses or whatever that come out of it and this is one too because when we understand how brains work we re going to be able to build intelligent machines and i think that s actually a good thing on the whole and it s going to have tremendous benefits to society just like a fundamental technology so why do n t we have a good theory of brains and people have been working on it for 100 years well let s first take a look at what normal science looks like this is normal science normal science is a nice balance between theory and experimentalists and so the theorist guys say well i think this is what s going on and the experimentalist says no you re wrong and it goes back and forth you know this works in physics this works in geology but if this is normal science what does neuroscience look like this is what neuroscience looks like we have this mountain of data which is anatomy physiology and behavior you ca n t imagine how much detail we know about brains there were 28 000 people who went to the neuroscience conference this year and every one of them is doing research in brains a lot of data but there s no theory there s a little wimpy box on top there and theory has not played a role in any sort of grand way in the neurosciences and it s a real shame now why has this come about if you ask neuroscientists why is this the state of affair they ll first of all admit it but if you ask them they ll say well there s various reasons we do n t have a good brain theory some people say well we do n t still have enough data we need to get more information there s all these things we do n t know well i just told you there s so much data coming out your ears we have so much information we do n t even know how to begin to organize it what good is more going to do maybe we ll be lucky and discover some magic thing but i do n t think so this is actually a symptom of the fact that we just do n t have a theory we do n t need more data we need a good theory about it another one is sometimes people say well brains are so complex it ll take another 50 years i even think chris said something like this yesterday i m not sure what you said chris but something like well it s one of the most complicated things in the universe that s not true you re more complicated than your brain you ve got a brain and it s also although the brain looks very complicated things look complicated until you understand them that s always been the case and so all we can say well my neocortex which is the part of the brain i m interested in has 30 billion cells but you know what it s very very regular in fact it looks like it s the same thing repeated over and over and over again it s not as complex as it looks that s not the issue some people say brains ca n t understand brains very zen like whoo you know it sounds good but why i mean what s the point it s just a bunch of cells you understand your liver it s got a lot of cells in it too right so you know i do n t think there s anything to that and finally some people say well you know i do n t feel like a bunch of cells you know i m conscious i ve got this experience i m in the world you know i ca n t be just a bunch of cells well you know people used to believe there was a life force to be living and we now know that s really not true at all and there s really no evidence that says well other than people just have disbelief that cells can do what they do and so if some people have fallen into the pit of metaphysical dualism some really smart people too but we can reject all that no i m going to tell you there s something else and it s really fundamental and this is what it is there s another reason why we do n t have a good brain theory and it s because we have an intuitive strongly held but incorrect assumption that has prevented us from seeing the answer there s something we believe that just it s obvious but it s wrong now there s a history of this in science and before i tell you what it is i m going to tell you a bit about the history of it in science you look at some other scientific revolutions and this case i m talking about the solar system that s copernicus darwin s evolution and tectonic plates that s wegener they all have a lot in common with brain science first of all they had a lot of unexplained data a lot of it but it got more manageable once they had a theory the best minds were stumped really really smart people we re not smarter now than they were then it just turns out it s really hard to think of things but once you ve thought of them it s kind of easy to understand it my daughters understood these three theories in their basic framework by the time they were in kindergarten and now it s not that hard you know here s the apple here s the orange you know the earth goes around that kind of stuff finally another thing is the answer was there all along but we kind of ignored it because of this obvious thing and that s the thing it was an intuitive strong held belief that was wrong in the case of the solar system the idea that the earth is spinning and the surface of the earth is going like a thousand miles an hour and the earth is going through the solar system about a million miles an hour this is lunacy we all know the earth is n t moving do you feel like you re moving a thousand miles an hour of course not you know and someone who said well it was spinning around in space and it s so huge they would lock you up and that s what they did back then so it was intuitive and obvious now what about evolution evolution s the same thing we taught our kids well the bible says you know god created all these species cats are cats dogs are dogs people are people plants are plants they do n t change noah put them on the ark in that order blah blah blah and you know the fact is if you believe in evolution we all have a common ancestor and we all have a common ancestry with the plant in the lobby this is what evolution tells us and it s true it s kind of unbelievable and the same thing about tectonic plates you know all the mountains and the continents are kind of floating around on top of the earth you know it s like it does n t make any sense so what is the intuitive but incorrect assumption that s kept us from understanding brains now i m going to tell it to you and it s going to seem obvious that that is correct and that s the point right then i m going to have to make an argument why you re incorrect about the other assumption the intuitive but obvious thing is that somehow intelligence is defined by behavior that we are intelligent because of the way that we do things and the way we behave intelligently and i m going to tell you that s wrong what it is is intelligence is defined by prediction and i m going to work you through this in a few slides here give you an example of what this means here s a system engineers like to look at systems like this scientists like to look at systems like this they say well we have a thing in a box and we have its inputs and its outputs the ai people said well the thing in the box is a programmable computer because that s equivalent to a brain and we ll feed it some inputs and we ll get it to do something have some behavior and alan turing defined the turing test which is essentially saying we ll know if something s intelligent if it behaves identical to a human a behavioral metric of what intelligence is and this has stuck in our minds for a long period of time reality though i call it real intelligence real intelligence is built on something else we experience the world through a sequence of patterns and we store them and we recall them and when we recall them we match them up against reality and we re making predictions all the time it s an eternal metric there s an eternal metric about us sort of saying do we understand the world am i making predictions and so on you re all being intelligent right now but you re not doing anything maybe you re scratching yourself or picking your nose i do n t know but you re not doing anything right now but you re being intelligent you re understanding what i m saying because you re intelligent and you speak english you know what word is at the end of this sentence the word came into you and you re making these predictions all the time and then what i m saying is is that the eternal prediction is the output in the neocortex and that somehow prediction leads to intelligent behavior and here s how that happens let s start with a non intelligent brain well i ll argue a non intelligent brain we got hold of an old brain and we re going to say it s like a non mammal like a reptile so i ll say an alligator we have an alligator and the alligator has some very sophisticated senses it s got good eyes and ears and touch senses and so on a mouth and a nose it has very complex behavior it can run and hide it has fears and emotions it can eat you you know it can attack it can do all kinds of stuff but we do n t consider the alligator very intelligent not like in a human sort of way but it has all this complex behavior already now in evolution what happened first thing that happened in evolution with mammals we started to develop a thing called the neocortex and i m going to represent the neocortex here by this box that s sticking on top of the old brain neocortex means new layer it is a new layer on top of your brain if you do n t know it it s the wrinkly thing on the top of your head that it s got wrinkly because it got shoved in there and does n t fit no really that s what it is it s about the size of a table napkin and it does n t fit so it gets all wrinkly now look at how i ve drawn this here the old brain is still there you still have that alligator brain you do it s your emotional brain it s all those things and all those gut reactions you have and on top of it we have this memory system called the neocortex and the memory system is sitting over the sensory part of the brain and so as the sensory input comes in and feeds from the old brain it also goes up into the neocortex and the neocortex is just memorizing it s sitting there saying ah i m going to memorize all the things that are going on where i ve been people i ve seen things i ve heard and so on and in the future when it sees something similar to that again so in a similar environment or the exact same environment it ll play it back it ll start playing it back oh i ve been here before and when you ve been here before this happened next it allows you to predict the future it allows you to literally it feeds back the signals into your brain they ll let you see what s going to happen next will let you hear the word sentence before i said it and it s this feeding back into the old brain that ll allow you to make very more intelligent decisions this is the most important slide of my talk so i ll dwell on it a little bit and so all the time you say oh i can predict the things and if you re a rat and you go through a maze and then you learn the maze the next time you re in a maze you have the same behavior but all of a sudden you re smarter because you say oh i recognize this maze i know which way to go i ve been here before i can envision the future and that s what it s doing in humans by the way this is true for all mammals it s true for other mammals and in humans it got a lot worse in humans we actually developed the front part of the neocortex called the anterior part of the neocortex and nature did a little trick it copied the posterior part the back part which is sensory and put it in the front part and humans uniquely have the same mechanism on the front but we use it for motor control so we are now able to make very sophisticated motor planning things like that i do n t have time to get into all this but if you want to understand how a brain works you have to understand how the first part of the mammalian neocortex works how it is we store patterns and make predictions so let me give you a few examples of predictions i already said the word sentence in music if you ve heard a song before if you heard jill sing those songs before when she sings them the next note pops into your head already you anticipate it as you re going if it was an album of music the end of one album the next song pops into your head and these things happen all the time you re making these predictions i have this thing called the altered door thought experiment and the altered door thought experiment says you have a door at home and when you re here i m changing it i ve got a guy back at your house right now moving the door around and they re going to take your doorknob and move it over two inches and when you go home tonight you re going to put your hand out there and you re going to reach for the doorknob and you re going to notice it s in the wrong spot and you ll go whoa something happened it may take a second to figure out what it was but something happened now i could change your doorknob in other ways i can make it larger or smaller i can change its brass to silver i could make it a lever i can change your door put colors on i can put windows in i can change a thousand things about your door and in the two seconds you take to open your door you re going to notice that something has changed now the engineering approach to this the ai approach to this is to build a door database it has all the door attributes and as you go up to the door you know let s check them off one at time door door door you know color you know what i m saying we do n t do that your brain does n t do that what your brain is doing is making constant predictions all the time about what is going to happen in your environment as i put my hand on this table i expect to feel it stop when i walk every step if i missed it by an eighth of an inch i ll know something has changed you re constantly making predictions about your environment i ll talk about vision here briefly this is a picture of a woman and when you look at people your eyes are caught over at two to three times a second you re not aware of this but your eyes are always moving and so when you look at someone s face you d typically go from eye to eye to eye to nose to mouth now when your eye moves from eye to eye if there was something else there like a nose you d see a nose where an eye is supposed to be and you d go oh shit you know there s something wrong about this person and that s because you re making a prediction it s not like you just look over there and say what am i seeing now a nose that s okay no you have an expectation of what you re going to see every single moment and finally let s think about how we test intelligence we test it by prediction what is the next word in this you know this is to this as this is to this what is the next number in this sentence here s three visions of an object what s the fourth one that s how we test it it s all about prediction so what is the recipe for brain theory first of all we have to have the right framework and the framework is a memory framework not a computation or behavior framework it s a memory framework how do you store and recall these sequences or patterns it s spatio temporal patterns then if in that framework you take a bunch of theoreticians now biologists generally are not good theoreticians it s not always true but in general there s not a good history of theory in biology so i found the best people to work with are physicists engineers and mathematicians who tend to think algorithmically then they have to learn the anatomy and they ve got to learn the physiology you have to make these theories very realistic in anatomical terms anyone who gets up and tells you their theory about how the brain works and does n t tell you exactly how it s working in the brain and how the wiring works in the brain it is not a theory and that s what we re doing at the redwood neuroscience institute i would love to have more time to tell you we re making fantastic progress in this thing and i expect to be back up on this stage maybe this will be some other time in the not too distant future and tell you about it i m really really excited this is not going to take 50 years at all so what will brain theory look like first of all it s going to be a theory about memory not like computer memory it s not at all like computer memory it s very very different and it s a memory of these very high dimensional patterns like the things that come from your eyes it s also memory of sequences you cannot learn or recall anything outside of a sequence a song must be heard in sequence over time and you must play it back in sequence over time and these sequences are auto associatively recalled so if i see something i hear something it reminds me of it and then it plays back automatically it s an automatic playback and prediction of future inputs is the desired output and as i said the theory must be biologically accurate it must be testable and you must be able to build it if you do n t build it you do n t understand it so one more slide here what is this going to result in are we going to really build intelligent machines absolutely and it s going to be different than people think no doubt that it s going to happen in my mind first of all it s going to be built up we re going to build the stuff out of silicon the same techniques we use for building silicon computer memories we can use for here but they re very different types of memories and we re going to attach these memories to sensors and the sensors will experience real live real world data and these things are going to learn about their environment now it s very unlikely the first things you re going to see are like robots not that robots are n t useful and people can build robots but the robotics part is the hardest part that s the old brain that s really hard the new brain is actually kind of easier than the old brain so the first thing we re going to do are the things that do n t require a lot of robotics so you re not going to see c 3po you re going to more see things like you know intelligent cars that really understand what traffic is and what driving is and have learned that certain types of cars with the blinkers on for half a minute probably are n t going to turn things like that we can also do intelligent security systems anywhere where we re basically using our brain but not doing a lot of mechanics those are the things that are going to happen first but ultimately the world s the limit here i do n t know how this is going to turn out i know a lot of people who invented the microprocessor and if you talk to them they knew what they were doing was really significant but they did n t really know what was going to happen they could n t anticipate cell phones and the internet and all this kind of stuff they just knew like hey they were going to build calculators and traffic light controllers but it s going to be big in the same way this is like brain science and these memories are going to be a very fundamental technology and it s going to lead to very unbelievable changes in the next 100 years and i m most excited about how we re going to use them in science so i think that s all my time i m over it and i m going to end my talk right there
