i got a visit almost exactly a year ago a little over a year ago from a very senior person at the department of defense came to see me and said 1 600 of the kids that we ve sent out have come back missing at least one full arm whole arm shoulder disarticulation and we re doing the same thing we did for more or less that we ve done since the civil war a stick and a hook and they deserve more than that and literally this guy sat in my office in new hampshire and said i want you to give me something that we can put on these kids that ll pick up a raisin or a grape off a table they ll be able to put it in their mouth without destroying either one and they ll be able to know the difference without looking at it you know had efferent afferent and haptic response he finishes explaining that and i m waiting for the big 300 pound paper proposal and he said that s what i want from you i said look you re nuts that technology s just not available right now and it ca n t be done not in an envelope of a human arm with 21 degrees of freedom from your shoulder to your fingertips he said about two dozen of these 1 600 kids have come back bilateral you think it s bad to lose one arm that s an inconvenience compared to having both of them gone i got a day job and my nights and weekends are already filled up with things like let s supply water to the world and power to the world and educate all the kids which chris i will not talk about i do n t need another mission i keep thinking about these kids with no arms he says to me we ve done some work around the country we ve got some pretty amazing neurology and other people i said i ll take a field trip i ll go see what you got over the next month i visited lots of places some out here around the country found the best of the best i went down to washington i saw these guys and said i did what you asked me i looked at what s out there i still think you re nuts but not as nuts as i thought i put a team together a little over 13 months ago got up to 20 some odd people we said we re going to build a device that does what he wants we have 14 out of the 21 degrees of freedom you do n t need the ones in the last two fingers we put this thing together a couple of weeks ago we took it down to walter reed which is unfortunately more in the news these days we showed it to a bunch of guys one guy who described himself as being lucky because he lost his left arm and he s a righty he sat at a table with seven or eight of these other guys said he was lucky because he had his good arm and then he pushed himself back from the table he had no legs these kids have attitudes that you just ca n t believe so i m going to show you now without the skin on it a 30 second piece and then i m done but understand what you re looking at we made small enough to fit on a 50th percentile female so that we could put it in any of these people it s going to go inside something that we use in cat scans and mris of whatever is their good arm to make silicon rubber then coat it and paint it in 3d exact mirror image of their other limb so you wo n t see all the really cool stuff that s in this series elastic set of 14 actuators each one which has its own capability to sense temperature and pressure it also has a pneumatic cuff that holds it on so the more they put themselves under load the more it attaches they take the load off and it becomes again compliant i m going to show you a guy doing a couple of simple things with this that we demonstrated in washington can we look at this thing watch the fingers grab the thumb comes up wrist this weighs 6 9 pounds going to scratch his nose it s got 14 active degrees of freedom now he s going to pick up a pen with his opposed thumb and index finger now he s going to put that down pick up a piece of paper rotate all the degrees of freedom in his hand and wrist and read it
