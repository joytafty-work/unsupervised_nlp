hey i am michael shermer the director of the skeptics society the publisher of skeptic magazine we investigate claims of the paranormal pseudo science and fringe groups and cults and claims of all kinds between science and pseudo science and non science and junk science voodoo science pathological science bad science non science and plain old nonsense and unless you ve been on mars recently you know there s a lot of that out there some people call us debunkers which is kind of a negative term but let s face it there s a lot of bunk and we are like the bunko squads of the police departments out there flushing out well we re sort of like the ralph naders of bad ideas trying to replace bad ideas with good ideas i ll show you an example of a bad idea i brought this with me this was given to us by nbc dateline to test it s the it s produced by the quadro corporation of west virginia it s called the quadro 2000 dowser rod this was being sold to high school administrators for 900 dollars a piece it s a piece of plastic with a radio shack antenna attached to it you could dowse for all sorts of things but this particular one was built to dowse for marijuana in students lockers so the way it works is you go down the hallway and you see if it tilts toward a particular locker and then you open the locker so it looks something like this i ll show you no it well it has kind of a right leaning bias so i ll show well this is science so we ll do a controlled experiment it ll go this way for sure sir you want to empty your pockets please sir so the question was can it actually find marijuana in students lockers and the answer is if you open enough of them yes but in science we have to keep track of the misses not just the hits and that s probably the key lesson to my short talk here is that this is how psychics work astrologers and tarot card readers and so on people remember the hits they forget the misses in science we have to keep the whole database and look to see if the number of hits somehow stands out from the total number that you would expect by chance in this case we tested it we had two opaque boxes one with government approved thc marijuana and one with nothing and it got it 50 percent of the time which is exactly what you d expect with a coin flip model so that s just a fun little example here of the sorts of things we do skeptic is the quarterly publication each one has a particular theme like this one is on the future of intelligence are people getting smarter or dumber i have an opinion of this myself because of the business i m in but in fact people it turns out are getting smarter three iq points per 10 years going up sort of an interesting thing with science do n t think of skepticism as a thing or even science as a thing are science and religion compatible it s like are science and plumbing compatible these they re just two different things science is not a thing it s a verb it s a way of thinking about things it s a way of looking for natural explanations for all phenomena i mean what s more likely that extraterrestrial intelligences or multi dimensional beings travel across the vast distances of interstellar space to leave a crop circle in farmer bob s field in puckerbrush kansas to promote skeptic com our webpage or is it more likely that a reader of skeptic did this with photoshop and in all cases we have to ask what s the more likely explanation and before we say something is out of this world we should first make sure that it s not in this world what s more likely that arnold had a little extraterrestrial help in his run for the governorship or that the world weekly news makes stuff up and part of that the same theme is expressed nicely here in this sidney harris cartoon for those of you in the back it says here then a miracle occurs i think you need to be more explicit here in step two this single slide completely dismantles the intelligent design arguments there s nothing more to it than that you can say a miracle occurs it s just that it does n t explain anything it does n t offer anything there s nothing to test it s the end of the conversation for intelligent design creationists whereas and it s true scientists sometimes throw terms out as linguistic place fillers dark energy or dark matter or something like that until we figure out what it is we ll just call it this it s the beginning of the causal chain for science for intelligent design creationists it s the end of the chain so again we can ask this what s more likely are ufos alien spaceships or perceptual cognitive mistakes or even fakes this is a ufo shot from my house in altadena california looking down over pasadena and if it looks a lot like a buick hubcap it s because it is you do n t even need photoshop you do n t need high tech equipment you do n t need computers this was shot with a throwaway kodak instamatic camera you just have somebody off on the side with a hubcap ready to go camera s ready that s it so although it s possible that most of these things are fake or illusions or so on and that some of them are real it s more likely that all of them are fake like the crop circles on a more serious note in all of science we re looking for a balance between data and theory in the case of galileo he had two problems when he turned his telescope to saturn first of all there was no theory of planetary rings and second of all his data was grainy and fuzzy and he could n t quite make out what it was he was looking at so he wrote that he had seen i have observed that the furthest planet has three bodies and this is what he ended up concluding that he saw so without a theory of planetary rings and with only grainy data you ca n t have a good theory and it was n t solved until 1655 this is christiaan huygens s book in which he cataloged all the mistakes that people made in trying to figure out what was going on with saturn it was n t till huygens had two things he had a good theory of planetary rings and how the solar system operated and then he had better telescopic more fine grain data in which he could figure out that as the earth is going around faster according to kepler s laws than saturn then we catch up with it and we see the angles of the rings at different angles there and that in fact turns out to be true the problems with having a theory is that your theory may be loaded with cognitive biases so one of the problems of explaining why people believe weird things is that we have things on a simple level and then i ll go to more serious ones like we have a tendency to see faces this is the face on mars which was in 1976 where there was a whole movement to get nasa to photograph that area because people thought this was monumental architecture made by martians well it turns out here s the close up of it from 2001 if you squint you can still see the face and when you re squinting what you re doing is you re turning that from fine grain to coarse grain and so you re reducing the quality of your data and if i did n t tell you what to look for you d still see the face because we re programmed by evolution to see faces faces are important for us socially and of course happy faces faces of all kinds are easy to see you can see the happy face on mars there if astronomers were frogs perhaps they d see kermit the frog do you see him there little froggy legs or if geologists were elephants religious iconography discovered by a tennessee baker in 1996 he charged five bucks a head to come see the nun bun till he got a cease and desist from mother teresa s lawyer here s our lady of guadalupe and our lady of watsonville just down the street or is it up the street from here tree bark is particularly good because it s nice and grainy branchy black and white splotchy and you can get the pattern seeking humans are pattern seeking animals here s the virgin mary on the side of a glass window in sao paulo now here s the virgin mary made her appearance on a cheese sandwich which i got to actually hold in a las vegas casino of course this being america this casino paid 28 500 dollars on ebay for the cheese sandwich but who does it really look like the virgin mary it has that sort of puckered lips 1940s era look virgin mary in clearwater florida i actually went to see this one there was a lot of people there the faithful come to be in their wheelchairs and crutches and so on and we went down investigated just to give you a size that s dawkins me and the amazing randi next to this two two and a half story size image all these candles so many thousands of candles people had lit in tribute to this so we walked around the backside just to see what was going on here where it turns out wherever there s a sprinkler head and a palm tree you get the effect here s the virgin mary on the backside which they started to wipe off i guess you can only have one miracle per building so is it really a miracle of mary or is it a miracle of marge and then i m going to finish up with another example of this with audio auditory illusions there is this film white noise with michael keaton about the dead talking back to us by the way this whole business of talking to the dead it s not that big a deal anybody can do it turns out it s getting the dead to talk back that s the really hard part in this case supposedly these messages are hidden in electronic phenomena there s a reversespeech com web page from which i downloaded this stuff here is the forward this is the most famous one of all of these here s the forward version of the very famous song boy could n t you just listen to that all day all right here it is backwards and see if you can hear the hidden messages that are supposedly in there what did you get audience satan michael shermer satan ok well at least we got satan now i ll prime your auditory part of your brain to tell you what you re supposed to hear and then hear it again you ca n t miss it when i tell you what s there all right i m going to just end with a positive nice little story about the skeptics is a nonprofit educational organization we re always looking for little good things that people do and in england there s a pop singer very one of the top popular singers in england today katie melua and she wrote a beautiful song it was in the top five in 2005 called nine million bicycles in beijing it s a love story she s sort of the norah jones of the u k about how she much loves her guy and compared to nine million bicycles and so forth and she has this one passage here we are 12 billion light years from the edge that s a guess no one can ever say it s true but i know that i will always be with you well that s nice at least she got it close in america it would be we re 6 000 light years from the edge but my friend simon singh the particle physicist now turned science educator and he wrote the book the big bang and so on he uses every chance he gets to promote good science and so he wrote an op ed piece in the guardian about katie s song in which he said well we know exactly how old how far from the edge you know it s 12 it s 13 7 billion light years and it s not a guess we know within precise error bars there how close it is and so we can say although not absolutely true that it s pretty close to being true and to his credit katie called him up after this op ed piece came out and said i m so embarrassed i was a member of the astronomy club and i should have known better and she re cut the song so i ll end with the new version we are 13 7 billion light years from the edge of the observable universe that s a good estimate with well defined error bars and with the available information i predict that i will always be with you how cool is that
