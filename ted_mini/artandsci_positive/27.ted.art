my name is lovegrove i only know nine lovegroves two of which are my parents they are first cousins and you know what happens when you know so there s a terribly weird freaky side to me which i m fighting with all the time so to try and get through today i ve kind of disciplined myself with an 18 minute talk i was hanging on to have a pee i thought perhaps if i was hanging on long enough that would guide me through the 18 minutes okay i am known as captain organic and that s a philosophical position as well as an aesthetic position but today what i d like to talk to you about is that love of form and how form can touch people s soul and emotion not very long ago not many thousands of years ago we actually lived in caves and i do n t think we ve lost that coding system we respond so well to form but i m interested in creating intelligent form i m not interested at all in blobism or any of that superficial rubbish that you see coming out as design these this artificially induced consumerism i think it s atrocious my world is the world of people like amory lovins janine benyus james watson i m in that world but i work purely instinctively i m not a scientist i could have been perhaps but i work in this world where i trust my instincts so i am a 21st century translator of technology into products that we use everyday and relate beautifully and naturally with and we should be developing things we should be developing packaging for ideas which elevate people s perceptions and respect for the things that we dig out of the earth and translate into products for everyday use so the water bottle i ll begin with this concept of what i call dna dna design nature art these are the three things that condition my world here is a drawing by leonardo da vinci 500 years ago before photography it shows how observation curiosity and instinct work to create amazing art industrial design is the art form of the 21st century people like leonardo there have not been many had this amazingly instinctive curiosity i work from a similar position i do n t want to sound pretentious saying that but this is my drawing made on a digital pad a couple of years ago well into the 21st century 500 years later it s my impression of water impressionism being the most valuable art form on the planet as we know it 100 million dollars easily for a monet i use now a whole new process a few years ago i reinvented my process to keep up with people like greg lynn tom main zaha hadid rem koolhaas all these people that i think are persevering and pioneering with fantastic new ideas of how to create form this is all created digitally here you see the machining the milling of a block of acrylic this is what i show to the client to say that s what i want to do at that point i do n t know if that s possible at all it s a seductor but i just feel in my bones that that s possible so we go we look at the tooling we look at how that is produced these are the invisible things that you never see in your life this is the background noise of industrial design that is like an anish kapoor flowing through a richard serra it is more valuable than the product in my eyes i do n t have one when i do make some money i ll have one machined for myself this is the final product when they sent it to me i thought i d failed it felt like nothing it has to feel like nothing it was when i put the water in that i realized that i d put a skin on water itself it s an icon of water itself and it elevates people s perception of contemporary design each bottle is different meaning the water level will give you a different shape it s mass individualism from a single product it fits the hand it fits arthritic hands it fits children s hands it makes the product strong the tessellation it s a millefiori of ideas in the future they will look like that because we need to move away from those type of polymers and use that for medical equipment and more important things perhaps in life biopolymers these new ideas for materials will come into play in probably a decade it does n t look as cool does it but i can live up to that i do n t have a problem with that i design for that condition biopolymers it s the future i took this video in cape town last year this is the freaky side coming out i have this special interest in things like this which blow my mind i do n t know whether to you know drop to my knees cry i do n t know what i think but i just know that nature improves with ever greater purpose that which once existed and that strangeness is a consequence of innovative thinking when i look at these things they look pretty normal to me but these things evolved over many years and now what we re trying to do i get three weeks to design a telephone how the hell do i do a telephone in three weeks when you get these things that take hundreds of million years to evolve how do you condense that it comes back to instinct i m not talking about designing telephones that look like that and i m not looking at designing architecture like that i m just interested in natural growth patterns and the beautiful forms that only nature really creates how that flows through me and how that comes out is what i m trying to understand this is a scan through the human forearm it s then blown up through rapid prototyping to reveal the cellular structure i have these in my office my office is a mixture of the natural history museum and a nasa space lab it s a weird kind of freaky place this is one of my specimens this is made bone is made from a mixture of inorganic minerals and polymers i studied cooking in school for four years and in that experience which was called domestic science it was a bit of a cheap trick for me to try and get a science qualification actually i put marijuana in everything i cooked and i had access to all the best girls it was fabulous all the guys in the rugby team could n t understand but anyway this is a meringue this is another sample i have a meringue is made exactly the same way in my estimation as a bone it s made from polysaccharides and proteins if you pour water on that it dissolves could we be manufacturing from foodstuffs in the future not a bad idea i do n t know i need to talk to janine and a few other people about that but i believe instinctively that that meringue can become something a car i do n t know i m also interested in growth patterns the unbridled way that nature grows things so you re not restricted by form at all these interrelated forms they do inspire everything i do although i might end up making something incredibly simple this is a detail of a chair that i ve designed in magnesium it shows this interlocution of elements and the beauty of kind of engineering and biological thinking shown pretty much as a bone structure any one of those elements you could sort of hang on the wall as some kind of art object it s the world s first chair made in magnesium it cost 1 7 million dollars to develop it s called go by bernhardt usa it went into time magazine in 2001 as the new language of the 21st century boy for somebody growing up in wales in a little village that s enough it shows how you make one holistic form like the car industry and then you break up what you need this is an absolutely beautiful way of working it s a godly way of working it s organic and it s essential it s an absolutely fat free design and when you look at it you see human beings bless you when that moves into polymers you can change the elasticity the fluidity of the form this is an idea for a gas injected one piece polymer chair what nature does is it drills holes in things it liberates form it takes away anything extraneous that s what i do i make organic things which are essential i do n t and they look funky too but i do n t set out to make funky things because i think that s an absolute disgrace i set out to look at natural forms if you took the idea of fractal technology further take a membrane shrinking it down constantly like nature does that could be a seat for a chair it could be a sole for a sports shoe it could be a car blending into seats wow let s go for it that s the kind of stuff this is what exists in nature observation now allows us to bring that natural process into the design process every day that s what i do this is a show that s currently on in tokyo it s called superliquidity it s my sculptural investigation it s like 21st century henry moore when you see a henry moore still your hair stands up there s some amazing spiritual connect if he was a car designer phew we d all be driving one in his day he was the highest taxpayer in britain that is the power of organic design it contributes immensely to our sense of being our sense of relationships with things our sensuality and you know the sort of even the sort of socio erotic side which is very important this is my artwork this is all my process these actually are sold as artwork they re very big prints but this is how i get to that object ironically that object was made by the killarney process which is a brand new process here for the 21st century and i can hear greg lynn laughing his socks off as i say that i ll tell you about that later when i look into these data images i see new things i m self it s self inspired diatomic structures radiolaria the things that we could n t see but we can do now these again are cored out they re made virtually from nothing they re made from silica why not structures from cars like that coral all these natural forces take away what they do n t need and they deliver maximum beauty we need to be in that realm i want to do stuff like that this is a new chair which should come on the market in september it s for a company called moroso in italy it s a gas injected polymer chair those holes you see there are very filtered down watered down versions of the extremity of the diatomic structures it goes with the flow of the polymer and you ll see there s an image coming up right now that shows the full thing it s great to have companies in italy who support this way of dreaming if you see the shadows that come through that they re actually probably more important than the product but it s the minimum it takes the coring out of the back lets you breathe it takes away any material you do n t need and it actually garners flexure too so i was going to break into a dance then this is some current work i m doing i m looking at single surface structures and how they flow how they stretch and flow it s based on furniture typologies but that s not the end motivation it s made from aluminum as opposed to aluminium and it s grown it s grown in my mind and then it s grown in terms of the whole process that i go through this is two weeks ago in ccp in coventry who build parts for bentleys and so on it s being built as we speak and it will be on show in phillips next year in new york i have a big show with phillips auctioneers when i see these animations oh jesus i m blown away this is what goes on in my studio everyday i walk i m traveling i come back some guy s got that on a computer there s this like oh my goodness so i try to create this energy of invention every day in my studio this kind of effervescent fully charged sense of soup that delivers ideas single surface products furniture s a good one how you grow legs out of a surface i would love to build this one day and perhaps i d like to build it also out of flour sugar polymer wood chips i do n t know human hair i do n t know i d love a go at that i do n t know if i just got some time that s the weird side coming out again and a lot of companies do n t understand that three weeks ago i was with sony in tokyo they said give us the dream what is our dream how do we beat apple i said well you do n t copy apple that s for sure i said you get into biopolymers they looked straight through me what a waste anyway no it s true fuck em fuck em you know i mean i m delivering they re not taking i ve had this image 20 years i ve had this image of a water droplet for 20 years sitting on a hot bed that is an image of a car for me that s the car of the future it s a water droplet i ve been banging on about this like i ca n t believe cars are all wrong i m going to show you something a bit weird now they laughed everywhere over the world i showed this the only place that did n t laugh was moscow its cars are made from 30 000 components how ridiculous is that could n t you make that from 300 it s got a vacuum formed carbon nylon pan everything s holistically integrated it opens and closes like a bread bin there is no engine there s a solar panel on the back and there are batteries in the wheels they re fitted like formula one you take them off your wall you plug them in off you jolly well go a three wheeled car slow feminine transparent so you can see the people in there you drive different you see that thing you do you do and not anaesthetized separated from life there s a hole at the front and there s a reason for that it s a city car you drive along you get out you drive on to a proboscis you get out it lifts you up it presents the solar panel to the sun and at night it s a street lamp that s what happens if you get inspired by the street lamp first and then do the car second these bubbles i can see these bubbles with these hydrogen packages floating around on the ground driven by ai when i showed this in south africa everybody after was going yeah hey car on a stick like this can you imagine a car on a stick if you put it next to contemporary architecture it feels totally natural to me and that s what i do with my furniture i m not putting charles eames furniture in buildings anymore forget that we move on i m trying to build furniture that fits architecture i m trying to build transportation systems i work on aircraft for airbus the whole thing i do all this sort of stuff trying to force these natural inspired by nature dreams home i m going to finish on two things this is the steriolithography of a staircase it s a little bit of a dedication to james james watson i built this thing for my studio it cost me 250 000 dollars to build this most people go and buy the aston martin i built this this is the data that goes with that incredibly complex took about two years because i m looking for fat free design lean efficient things healthy products this is built by composites it s a single element which rotates around to create a holistic element and this is a carbon fiber handrail which is only supported in two places modern materials allow us to do modern things this is a shot in the studio this is how it looks pretty much every day you would n t want to have a fear of heights coming down it there is virtually no handrail it does n t pass any standards who cares yeah and it has an internal handrail which gives it it s strength it s this holistic integration that s my studio it s subterranean it s in notting hill next to all the crap you know the prostitutes and all that stuff it s next to david hockney s original studio it has a lighting system that changes throughout the day my guys go out for lunch the door s open they come back in because it s normally raining and they prefer to stay in this is my studio elephant skull from oxford university 1988 i bought that last year they re very difficult to find i would if anybody s got a whale skeleton they want to sell me i ll put it in the studio so i m just going to interject a little bit with some of the things that you ll see in the video it s a homemade video made it myself at three o clock in the morning just to show you how my real world is you never see that you never see architects or designers showing you their real world this is called a plasnet it s a bio polycarbonate new chair i m doing in italy world s first bamboo bike with folding handlebars we should all be riding one of these as china buys all these crappy cars we should be riding things like this counterbalance like i say it s a cross between natural history museum and a nasa laboratory it s full of prototypes and objects it s self inspirational again i mean the rare times when i m there i do enjoy it and i get lots of kids coming lots and lots of kids coming i m a contaminator for all those children of investment bankers wankers this sorry that s a solar seed it s a concept for new architecture that thing on the top is the world s first solar powered garden lamp the first produced giles revell should be talking here today amazing photography of things you ca n t see the first sculptural model i made for that thing in tokyo lots of stuff there s a little leaf chair that golden looking thing is called leaf it s made from kevlar on the wall is my book called supernatural which allows me to remember what i ve done because i forget there s an aerated brick i did in limoges last year in concepts for new ceramics in architecture unclear working at three o clock in the morning and i do n t pay overtime overtime is the passion of design so join the club or do n t no it s true it s true people like tom and greg we re traveling like you ca n t we fit it all in i do n t know how we do it next week i m at electrolux in sweden then i m in beijing on friday you work that one out and when i see ed s photographs i think why the hell am i going to china it s true it s true because there s a soul in this whole thing we need to have a new instinct for the 21st century we need to combine all this stuff if all the people who were talking over this period worked on a car together it would be a joy absolute joy so there s a new x light system i m doing in japan there s tuareg shoes from north africa there s a kifwebe mask these are my sculptures a copper jelly mold it sounds like some quiz show or something does n t it so it s going to end thank you james for your great inspiration thank you very much
