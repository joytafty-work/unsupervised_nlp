in terms of invention i d like to tell you the tale of one of my favorite projects i think it s one of the most exciting that i m working on but i think it s also the simplest it s a project that has the potential to make a huge impact around the world it addresses one of the biggest health issues on the planet the number one cause of death in children under five which is water borne diseases diarrhea malnutrition no it s breathing the smoke from indoor cooking fires acute respiratory infections caused by this can you believe that i find this shocking and somewhat appalling ca n t we make cleaner burning cooking fuels ca n t we make better stoves how is it that this can lead to over two million deaths every year i know bill joy was talking to you about the wonders of carbon nanotubes so i m going to talk to you about the wonders of carbon macro tubes which is charcoal so this is a picture of rural haiti haiti is now 98 percent deforested you ll see scenes like this all over the island it leads to all sorts of environmental problems and problems that affect people throughout the nation a couple years ago there was severe flooding that led to thousands of deaths that s directly attributable to the fact that there are no trees on the hills to stabilize the soil so the rains come they go down the rivers and the flooding happens now one of the reasons why there are so few trees is this people need to cook and they harvest wood and they make charcoal in order to do it it s not that people are ignorant to the environmental damage they know perfectly well but they have no other choice fossil fuels are not available and solar energy does n t cook the way that they like their food prepared and so this is what they do you ll find families like this who go out into the forest to find a tree cut it down and make charcoal out of it so not surprisingly there s a lot of effort that s been done to look at alternative cooking fuels about four years ago i took a team of students down to haiti and we worked with peace corps volunteers there this is one such volunteer and this is a device that he had built in the village where he worked and the idea was that you could take waste paper you could compress it and make briquettes that could be used for fuel but this device was very slow so our engineering students went to work on it and with some very simple changes they were able to triple the throughput of this device so you could imagine they were very excited about it and they took the briquettes back to mit so that they could test them and one of the things that they found was they did n t burn so it was a little discouraging to the students and in fact if you look closely right here you can see it says u s peace corps as it turns out there actually was n t any waste paper in this village and while it was a good use of government paperwork for this volunteer to bring it back with him to his village it was 800 kilometers away and so we thought perhaps there might be a better way to come up with an alternative cooking fuel what we wanted to do is we wanted to make a fuel that used something that was readily available on the local level you see these all over haiti as well they re small scale sugar mills and the waste product from them after you extract the juice from the sugarcane is called bagasse it has no other use it has no nutritional value so they do n t feed it to the animals it just sits in a pile near the sugar mill until eventually they burn it what we wanted to do was we wanted to find a way to harness this waste resource and turn it into a fuel that would be something that people could easily cook with something like charcoal so over the next couple of years students and i worked to develop a process so you start with the bagasse and then you take a very simple kiln that you can make out of a waste fifty five gallon oil drum after some time after setting it on fire you seal it to restrict the oxygen that goes into the kiln and then you end up with this carbonized material here however you ca n t burn this it s too fine and it burns too quickly to be useful for cooking so we had to try to find a way to form it into useful briquettes and conveniently one of my students was from ghana and he remembered a dish his mom used to make for him called kokonte which is a very sticky porridge made out of the cassava root and so what we did was we looked and we found that cassava is indeed grown in haiti under the name of manioc and in fact it s grown all over the world yucca tapioca manioc cassava it s all the same thing a very starchy root vegetable and you can make a very thick sticky porridge out of it which you can use to bind together the charcoal briquettes so we did this we went down to haiti these are the graduates of the first ecole de chabon or charcoal institute and these that s right so i m actually an instructor at mit as well as cit and these are the briquettes that we made now i m going to take you to a different continent this is india and this is the most commonly used cooking fuel in india it s cow dung and more than in haiti this produces really smoky fires and this is where you see the health impacts of cooking with cow dung and biomass as a fuel kids and women are especially affected by it because they re the ones who are around the cooking fires so we wanted to see if we could introduce this charcoal making technology there well unfortunately they did n t have sugarcane and they did n t have cassava but that did n t stop us what we did was we found what were the locally available sources of biomass and there was wheat straw and there was rice straw in this area and what we could use as a binder was actually small amounts of cow manure which they used ordinarily for their fuel and we did side by side tests and here you can see the charcoal briquettes and here the cow dung and you can see that it s a lot cleaner burning of a cooking fuel and in fact it heats the water a lot more quickly and so we were very happy thus far but one of the things that we found was when we did side by side comparisons with wood charcoal it did n t burn as long and the briquettes crumbled a little bit and we lost energy as they fell apart as they were cooking so we wanted to try to find a way to make a stronger briquette so that we could compete with wood charcoal in the markets in haiti so we went back to mit we took out the instron machine and we figured out what sort of forces did you need in order to compress a briquette to the level that you actually are getting improved performance out of it and at the same time that we had students in the lab looking at this we also had community partners in haiti working to develop the process to improve it and to make it more accessible to people in the villages there and after some time we developed a low cost press that allows you to produce charcoal which actually now burns longer cleaner than wood charcoal so now we re in a situation where we have a product which is actually better than what you can buy in haiti in the marketplace which is a very wonderful place to be in haiti alone about 30 million trees are cut down every year there s a possibility of this being implemented and saving a good portion of those in addition the revenue generated from that charcoal is 260 million dollars that s an awful lot for a country of haiti with a population of eight million and an average income of less than 400 dollars so this is where we re also moving ahead with our charcoal project and one of the things that i think is also interesting is i have a friend up at uc berkeley who s been doing risk analysis and he s looked at the problem of the health impacts of burning wood versus charcoal and he s found that worldwide you could prevent a million deaths switching from wood to charcoal as a cooking fuel that s remarkable but up until now there were n t ways to do it without cutting down trees but now we have a way that s using an agricultural waste material to create a cooking fuel one of the really exciting things though is something that came out of the trip that i took to ghana just last month and this is i think the coolest thing and it s even lower tech than what you just saw if you can imagine such a thing here it is so what is this this is corncobs turned into charcoal and the beauty of this is that you do n t need to form briquettes it comes ready made this is my 100 laptop right here and actually like nick i brought samples so we can pass these around they re fully functional field tested ready to roll out and i think one of the things which is also remarkable about this technology is that the technology transfer is so easy compared to the sugarcane charcoal where we actually have to teach people how to form it into briquettes and you have the extra step of cooking the binder this comes pre briquetted and this is about the most exciting thing in my life right now which is perhaps a sad commentary on my life but once you see it like you guys in the front row all right yeah ok so anyway here it is and this is i think a perfect example of what robert wright was talking about in those non zero sum things so not only do you have health benefits you have environmental benefits but this is one of the incredibly rare situations where you also have economic benefits people can make their own cooking fuel from waste products they can generate income from this they can save the money that they were going to spend on charcoal and they can produce excess and sell it in the market to people who are n t making their own it s really rare that you do n t have trade offs between health and economics or environment and economics so this is a project that i just find extremely exciting and i m really looking forward to see where it takes us so when we talk about now the future we will create one of the things that i think is necessary is to have a very clear vision of the world that we live in and now i do n t actually mean the world that we live in i mean the world where women spend two to three hours everyday grinding grain for their families to eat i mean the world where advanced building materials means cement roofing tiles that are made by hand and where when you work 10 hours a day you re still only earning 60 dollars in a month i mean the world where women and children spend 40 billion hours a year fetching water that s as if the entire workforce of the state of california worked full time for a year doing nothing but fetching water it s a place where for example if this were india in this room only three of us would have a car if this were afghanistan only one person in this room would know how the use the internet if this were zambia 300 of you would be farmers 100 of you would have aids or hiv and more than half of you would be living on less than a dollar a day these are the issues that we need to come up with solutions for these are the issues that we need to be training our engineers our designers our business people our entrepreneurs to be facing these are the solutions that we need to find i have a few areas that i believe are especially important that we address one of them is creating technologies to promote micro finance and micro enterprise so that people who are living below the poverty line can find a way to move out and that they re not doing it using the same traditional basket making poultry rearing etc but there are new technologies and new products that they can make on a small scale the next thing i believe is that we need to create technologies for poor farmers to add value to their own crops and we need to rethink our development strategies so that we re not promoting educational campaigns to get them to stop being farmers but rather to stop being poor farmers and we need to think about how we can do that effectively we need to work with the people in these communities and give them the resources and the tools that they need to solve their own problems that s the best way to do it we should n t be doing it from outside so we need to create this future and we need to start doing it now thank you chris anderson tell us just while we see if someone has a question just tell us about one of the other things that you ve worked on amy smith a couple of other things that we re working on are looking at ways to do low cost water quality testing so that communities can maintain their own water systems know when they re working know when they treat them etc we re also looking at low cost water treatment systems one of the really exciting things is looking at solar water disinfection and improving the ability to be able to do that ca what s the bottleneck to preventing this stuff getting from scale do you need to find entrepreneurs or venture capitalists or what do you need to take what you ve got and get it to scale as yeah i think its large numbers of people moving it forward it s a difficult thing it s a marketplace which is very fragmented and a consumer population with no income so you ca n t use the same models that you use in the united states for making things move forward and we re a pretty small staff which is me so you know i do what i can with the students we have 30 students a year go out into the field and try to implement this and move it forward the other thing is you have to do things with a long time frame as you know you ca n t expect to get something done in a year or two years you have to be looking five or 10 years ahead but i think with the vision to do that we can move forward
