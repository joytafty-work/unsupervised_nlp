you know when chris first approached me to speak at ted i said no because i felt like i was n t going to be able to make that personal connection you know that i wanted to it s such a large conference but he explained to me that he was in a bind and that he was having trouble finding the kind of sex appeal and star power that the conference was known for so i said fine ted i mean chris i ll come on two conditions one i want to speak as early in the morning as possible and two i want to pick the theme for ted 2006 and luckily he agreed and the theme in two years is going to be cute pictures of puppies i invented the placebo camera it does n t actually take pictures but it s a hell of a lot cheaper and you still feel like you were there dear sir good day compliments of the day and my best wishes to you and family i know this letter will come to you surprisingly but let it not be a surprise to you for nature has a way of arriving unannounced and as an adage says originals are very hard to find but their echoes sound louder so i decided to contact you myself for you to assure me of safety and honesty if i have to entrust any amount of money under your custody i am mister michael bangoora the son of late mister tiamu bangoora who was the minister of finance in sierra leone but was killed during a civil war knowing your country to be economical conducive for investment and your people as transparent and trustworthy to engage in business on which premise i write you before my father death he had the sum of 23 million united states dollars which he kept away from the rebel leaders during the course of the war this fund was supposed to be used for the rehabilitation of water reserves all over the country before the outbreak of war when the war broke out the rebel leader demanded that the fund be given to him my father insisted it was not in his possession and he was killed because of his refusal to release the fund meanwhile my mother and i is the only person who knows about the fund because my father always confide in me i quickly made an arrangement with a red cross relief worker who used his official van to transport the money to lungi airport freetown although he did not know the real contents of the box the fund was deposited as a family reassure in a safe reliable security company in dakar senegal where i was only given temporary asylum i do not wish to invest the money in senegal due to unfavorable economic climate and so close to my country the only assistance i need from you which i know you would do for me are the following one be a silent partner and receive the funds in your account in trust two provide a bank account under your control to which the funds will be remitted three receive the funds into your account in trust take out your commission and leave the rest of the money until i arrive after the transfer is complete sincerely mister michael bangoora this is really embarrassing i was told backstage that i have 18 minutes i only prepared 15 so if it s cool i d like to just wait for three i m really sorry what s your name mark serfaas it s pretty cool huh pursuing happiness are you a virgin virgin i mean no i mean like in the ted sense are you oh yeah so what are you like a thousand two thousand somewhere in there huh oh you do n t know what i m talking about ah mark serfaas 1 860 am i good and that s nothing to be ashamed of that s nothing to be ashamed of yeah i was hanging out with some google guys last night really cool we were getting wasted and they were telling me that google software has gotten so advanced that based on your interaction with google over your lifetime they can actually predict what you are going to say next and i was like get the fuck out of here that s crazy but they said no but do n t show anyone but they slipped up and they said that i could just type in what was i going to say next and my name and it would tell me and i have to tell you right now this is an unadulterated piece of software this is a real internet browser and this is an actual google site and we re going to test it out live today what was i going to say next and ze frank that s me am i feeling lucky am i feeling lucky audience yes ze frank oh amazing in march of 2001 i filmed myself dancing to madonna s justify my love on a thursday i sent out a link to a website that featured those clips to 17 of my closest friends as part of my an invitation to my an invitation to my th th 26th birthday party by monday over a million people were coming to this site a day within a week i received a call from earthlink that said due to a 10 cents per megabyte overage charge i owed them 30 000 dollars needless to say i was able to leave my job and finally you know become freelance but some people refer to me more of as like an internet guru or swami i i knew i had something i d basically distilled a very difficult to explain and complex philosophy which i wo n t get into here because it s a little too deep for all of you but it s about what makes websites popular and you know it s it s unfortunate that i do n t have more time maybe i can come back next year or something like that i m obsessed with email i get a lot of it four years later i still get probably two or three hundred emails a day from people i do n t know and it s been an amazing opportunity to kind of get to know different cultures you know it s like a microscope to the rest of the world you can kind of peer into other people s lives and i also feel like i get a lot of inspiration from the average user for example somebody wrote me they said hey ze if you ever come to boulder you should rock out with us and i said why wait and they said hey ze thanks for rocking out but i meant the kind of rocking out where we d be naked and that was embarrassing but you know it s kind of a collaboration between me and the fans so i said sure i hear a lot of you whispering and i know what you re saying you re saying holy crap how is his presentation so smooth and i have to say that it s not all me this year i guess chris has to take some credit here because in years past i guess there s been some sort of subpar speakers at ted i do n t know and so this year chris sent us a ted conference simulator which really allowed us as speakers to get there in the trenches and practice at home so that we would be ready for this experience and i gotta say that you know it s really really great to be here i d like to tell all of you a little joke not just the good stuff though you can do heckler mode voice hey moron get off the stage zf you get off the stage voice we want malcolm gladwell in case you run over time i d just one last thing i d like to say i d really like to thank all of you for being here and frog mode ah the first time that i made love to a rock shrimp it s true some people say to me they say ze you re doing all this stuff this internet stuff and you re not making any money why and i say mom dad i m trying you know i do n t know if you re all aware of this but the video the video game market kids are playing these video games oh but supposedly there s tons of money i mean like i think 100 000 dollars or so a year is being spent on these things so i decided to try my hand i came up with a few games this is called atheist i figured it d be popular with the young kids look i ll move around and say some things so that did n t go over so well i do n t really understand why you re laughing should have done this before i tried to pitch it buddhist of course looks very very similar to atheist but you come back as a duck and this is great because you know for a quarter you can play this for a long time and chris had said in an email that you know we should really bring something new to ted something that we have n t shown anyone so i made this for ted it s christian it s the third in the series i m hoping it s going to do well this year do you have a preference good choice so you can wait for the second coming which is a random number between one and 500 million so really what are we talking about here oh tech joy tech joy to me means something because i get a lot of joy out of tech and in fact making things using technology and i m being serious here even though i m using my sarcastic voice i wo n t hold on making things you know making things actually does give me a lot of joy it s the process of creation that keeps me sort of a bubble and a half above perpetual anxiety in my life and it s that feeling of being about 80 percent complete on a project where you know you still have something to do but it s not finished and you re not starting something that really fills my entire life and so what i ve done is i started getting interested in creating online social spaces to share that feeling with people who do n t consider themselves artists we re in a culture of guru ship it s so hard to use some software because you know it s unapproachable people feel like they have to read the manual so i try to i try to create these very minimal activities that allow people to express themselves and hopefully whoa i m like on the page but it does n t exist it s like seriously though i try to create meaningful environments for people to express themselves here i created a contest called when office supplies attack which i think really resonated with the working population over 500 entries in three weeks toilet paper fashion again people from all over the country doing the watch is particularly incredible online drawing tools you ve probably seen a lot of them i think they re wonderful i think it s a chance for people to get to play with crayons and all that kind of stuff but i m interested in the process the process of creating as the real event that i m interested in and the problem is that a lot of people suck at drawing and they get bummed out at this sort of you know stick figure awful little thing that they created and eventually it just makes them stop playing with it or draw you know they draw penises and things like that so the scribbler is an attempt to create a generative tool in other words it s a helping tool you can draw your simple stick figure and then it collaborates with you to create sort of like a post war german etching so you can in fact it s tuned to be better at drawing things that look worse so we go ahead and we start scribbling and so the idea is that you can really you know partake in this process but watch something really crappy look beautiful and here are some of my favorites this is the little trap marionette that was submitted to me here we are very cool darling beautiful stuff i mean this is incredible this is an 11 year old girl drew this and submitted it it s just gorgeous i m i m dead serious here i m actually this is not a joke but i think it s a it s a really fun and wonderful thing so this is called the fiction project this is an online space which is it s basically a refurbished message board that encourages collaborative fiction writing these are haikus none of the haikus were written by the same person and in fact no line was you know each line is contributed by a different person at a different at a different time i think that the now tied up tied down mistress cruel approaches me now tied down it s up it s it s an amazing way and i ll tell you if you come home and your spouse or whoever it is says let s talk that like chills you to the very core but it s peripheral activities like these that allow people to get together doing fun things they actually get to know each other and it s sort of like low threshold peripheral activities that i think are the key to bringing up some of our bonding social capital that we re lacking and very very quickly i love puppets here s a puppet it dances to music lotte reiniger an amazing shadow puppeteer in the 20s that started doing more elaborate things i became interested in puppets and i just want to show one last thing to you oh this is how you make puppets chris anderson ladies and gentlemen mr ze frank
