i want to start off by saying houston we have a problem we re entering a second generation of no progress in terms of human flight in space in fact we ve regressed we stand a very big chance of losing our ability to inspire our youth to go out and continue this very important thing that we as a species have always done and that is instinctively we ve gone out and climbed over difficult places went to more hostile places and found out later maybe to our surprise that that s the reason we survived and i feel very strongly that it s not good enough for us to have generations of kids that think that it s ok to look forward to a better version of a cell phone with a video in it they need to look forward to exploration they need to look forward to colonization they need to look forward to breakthroughs we need to inspire them because they need to lead us and help us survive in the future i m particularly troubled that what nasa s doing right now with this new bush doctrine to for this next decade and a half oh shoot i screwed up we have real specific instructions here not to talk about politics what we re looking forward to is what we re looking forward to is not only the inspiration of our children but the current plan right now is not really even allowing the most creative people in this country the boeing s and lockheed s space engineers to go out and take risks and try new stuff we re going to go back to the moon 50 years later and we re going to do it very specifically planned to not learn anything new i m really troubled by that but anyway that s the basis of the thing that i want to share with you today though is that right back to where we inspire people who will be our great leaders later that s the theme of my next 15 minutes here and i think that the inspiration begins when you re very young three year olds up to 12 14 year olds what they look at is the most important thing let s take a snapshot at aviation and there was a wonderful little short four year time period when marvelous things happened it started in 1908 when the wright brothers flew in paris and everybody said ooh hey i can do that there s only a few people that have flown in early 1908 in four years 39 countries had hundreds of airplanes thousand of pilots airplanes were invented by natural selection now you can say that intelligent design designs our airplanes of today but there was no intelligent design really designing those early airplanes there were probably at least 30 000 different things tried and when they crash and kill the pilot do n t try that again the ones that flew and landed ok because there were no trained pilots who had good flying qualities by definition so we by making a whole bunch of attempts thousands of attempts in that four year time period we invented the concepts of the airplanes that we fly today and that s why they re so safe as we gave it a lot of chance to find what s good that has not happened at all in space flying there s only been two concepts tried two by the u s and one by the russians well who was inspired during that time period aviation week asked me to make a list of who i thought were the movers and shakers of the first 100 years of aviation and i wrote them down and i found out later that every one of them was a little kid in that wonderful renaissance of aviation well what happened when i was a little kid was some pretty heavy stuff too the jet age started the missile age started von braun was on there showing how to go to mars and this was before sputnik and this was at a time when mars was a hell of a lot more interesting than it is now we thought there d be animals there we knew there were plants there the colors change right but you know nasa screwed that up because they ve sent these robots and they ve landed it only in the deserts if you look at what happened this little black line is as fast as man ever flew and the red line is top of the line military fighters and the blue line is commercial air transport you notice here s a big jump when i was a little kid and i think that had something to do with giving me the courage to go out and try something that other people were n t having the courage to try well what did i do when i was a kid i did n t do the hotrods and the girls and the dancing and well we did n t have drugs in those days but i did competition model airplanes i spent about seven years during the vietnam war flight testing airplanes for the air force and then i went in and i had a lot of fun building airplanes that people could build in their garages and some 3 000 of those are flying of course one of them is around the world voyager i founded another company in 82 which is my company now and we have developed more than one new type of airplane every year since 1982 and there s a lot of them that i actually ca n t show you on this chart the most impressive airplane ever i believe was designed only a dozen years after the first operational jet stayed in service till it was too rusty to fly taken out of service we retreated in 98 back to something that was developed in 56 what the most impressive spaceship ever i believe was a grumman lunar lander it was a you know it landed on the moon take off of the moon did n t need any maintenance guys that s kind of cool we ve lost that capability we abandoned it in 72 this thing was designed three years after gagarin first flew in space in 1961 three years and we ca n t do that now crazy talk very briefly about innovation cycles things that grow have a lot of activity they die out when they re replaced by something else these things tend to happen every 25 years 40 years long with an overlap you can put that statement on all kinds of different technologies the interesting thing by the way the speed here excuse me higher speed travel is the title of these innovation cycles there is none here these two new airplanes are the same speed as the dc 8 that was done in 1958 here s the biggie and that is you do n t have innovation cycles if the government develops and the government uses it you know a good example of course is the darpa net computers were used for artillery first then irs but when we got it now you have all the level of activity all the benefit from it private sector has to do it keep that in mind i put down innovation i ve looked for innovation cycles in space i found none the very first year starting when gagarin went in space and a few weeks later alan shepherd there were five manned space flights in the world the very first year in 2003 everyone that the united states sent to space was killed there were only three or four flights in 2003 in 2004 there were only two flights two russian soyuz flights to the international manned station and i had to fly three in mojave with my little group of a couple dozen people in order to get to a total of five which was the number the same year back in 1961 there is no growth there s no activity there s no nothing this is a picture here taken from spaceshipone this is a picture here taken from orbit our goal is to make it so that you can see this picture and really enjoy that we know how to do it for sub orbital flying now do it safe enough at least as safe as the early airlines so that can be done and i think i want to talk a little bit about why we had the courage to go out and try that as a small company well first of all what s going to happen next the first industry will be a high volume a lot of players there s another one announced just last week and it will be sub orbital and the reason it has to be sub orbital is there is not solutions for adequate safety to fly the public to orbit the governments have been doing this three governments have been doing this for 45 years and still four percent of the people that have left the atmosphere have died that s you do n t want to run a business with that kind of a safety record it ll be very high volume we think 100 000 people will fly by 2020 i ca n t tell you when this will start because i do n t want my competition to know my schedule but i think once it does we will find solutions and very quickly you ll see those resort hotels in orbit and that real easy thing to do which is a swing around the moon so you have this cool view and that will be really cool because the moon does n t have an atmosphere you can do an elliptical orbit and miss it by 10 feet if you want oh it s going to be so much fun ok my critics say hey rutan s just spending a lot of these billionaires money for joyrides for billionaires what s this this is not a transportation system it s just for fun and i used to be bothered by that and then i got to thinking well wait a minute i bought my first apple computer in 1978 and i bought it because i could say i got a computer at my house and you do n t what do you use it for come over it does frogger ok not the bank s computer or lockheed s computer but the home computer was for games for a whole decade it was for fun we did n t even know what it was for but what happened the fact that we had this big industry big development big improvement and capability and so on and they get out there in enough homes we were ripe for a new invention and the inventor is in this audience al gore invented the internet and because of that something that we used for a whole year excuse me a whole decade for fun became everything our commerce our research our communication and if we let the google guys think for another couple weekends we can add a dozen more things to the list and it wo n t be very long before you wo n t be able to convince kids that we did n t always have computers in our homes so fun is defendable ok i want to show you kind of a busy chart but in it is my prediction with what s going to happen and in it also brings up another point right here there s a group of people that have come forward and you do n t know all of them but the ones that have come forward were inspired as young children this little three to 15 year old age by us going to orbit and going to the moon here right in this time period paul allen elan musk richard branson jeff bezos the ansari family which is now funding the russians sub orbital thing bob bigelow a private space station and carmack these people are taking money and putting it in an interesting area and i think it s a lot better than they put it in an area of a better cell phone or something but they re putting it in very areas and this will lead us into this kind of capability and it will lead us into the next really big thing and it will allow us to explore and i think eventually it will allow us to colonize and to keep us from going extinct they were inspired by big progress but look at the progress that s going on after that there were a couple of examples here the military fighters had a highest performance military airplane was the sr 71 it went a whole life cycle got too rusty to fly and was taken out of service the concorde doubled the speed for airline travel it went a whole life cycle without competition took out of service and we re stuck back here with the same kind of capability for military fighters and commercial airline travel that we had back in the late 50s but something is out there to inspire our kids now and i m talking about if you ve got a baby now or if you ve got a 10 year old now what s out there is there s something really interesting going to happen here relatively soon you ll be able to buy a ticket and fly higher and faster than the highest performance military operational airplane it s never happened before the fact that they have stuck here with this kind of performance has been well you know you win the war in 12 minutes why do you need something better but i think when you guys start buying tickets and flying sub orbital flights to space very soon wait a minute what s happening here we ll have military fighters with sub orbital capability and i think very soon this but the interesting thing about it is the commercial guys are going to go first ok i look forward to a new capitalist s space race let s call it you remember the space race in the 60s was for national prestige because we lost the first two milestones we did n t lose them technically the fact that we had the hardware to put something in orbit when we let von braun fly it you can argue that s not a technical loss sputnik was n t a technical loss but it was a prestige loss america the world saw america as not being the leader in technology and that was a very strong thing and then we flew alan shepherd weeks after gagarin not months or decades or whatever so we had the capability but america lost we lost and because of that we made a big jump to recover it well again what s interesting here is we ve lost to the russians on the first couple of milestones already you cannot buy a ticket commercially to fly into space in america ca n t do it you can buy it in russia you can fly with russian hardware this is available because a russian space program is starving and it s nice for them to get 20 million here and there to take one of the seats it s commercial it can be defined as space tourism they are also offering a trip to go on this whip around the moon like apollo 8 was done 100 million bucks hey i can go to the moon but you know would you have thought back in the 60s when the space race was going on that the first commercial capitalist like thing to do to buy a ticket to go to the moon would be in russian hardware and would you have thought would the russians have thought that when they first go to the moon in their developed hardware the guys inside wo n t be russians maybe it ll probably be a japanese or an american billionaire well that s weird you know it really is but anyway i think we need to beat them again i think what we ll do is we ll see a successful very successful private space flight industry whether we re first or not really does n t matter the russians actually flew a supersonic transport before the concorde and then they flew a few cargo flights and took it out of service i think you kind of see the same kind of parallel when the commercial stuff is offered ok we ll talk just a little bit about commercial development for human space flight this little thing says here five times what nasa s doing by 2020 i want to tell you already there s about 1 5 billion to 1 7 billion investment in private space flight that is not government at all already worldwide if you read if you google it you ll find about half of that money but there s twice of that being committed out there not spent yet but being committed and planned for the next few years hey that s pretty big i m predicting though as profitable as this industry is going to be and it certainly is profitable when you fly people at 200 000 dollars on something that you can actually operate at a tenth of that cost or less this is going to be very profitable i predict also that the investment that will flow into this will be somewhere around half of what the u s taxpayer spends for nasa s manned spacecraft work and every dollar that flows into that will be spent more efficiently by a factor of 10 to 15 and what that means is before we know it the progress in human space flight with no taxpayer dollars will be at a level of about five times as much as the current nasa budgets for human space flight and that is because it s us it s private industry you should never depend on the government to do this sort of stuff and we ve done it for a long time the naca before nasa never developed an airliner and never ran an airline but nasa is developing the space liner always has and runs the only space line ok and we ve shied away from it because we re afraid of it but starting back in june of 2004 when i showed that a little group out there actually can do it can get a start with it everything changed after that time ok thank you very much
