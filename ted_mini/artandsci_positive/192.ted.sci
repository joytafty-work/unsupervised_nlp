you ve all seen lots of articles on climate change and here s yet another new york times article just like every other darn one you ve seen it says all the same stuff as all the other ones you ve seen it even has the same amount of headline as all the other ones you ve seen what s unusual about this one maybe is that it s from 1953 and the reason i m saying this is that you may have the idea this problem is relatively recent that people have just sort of figured out about it and now with kyoto and the governator and people beginning to actually do something we may be on the road to a solution the fact is uh uh we ve known about this problem for 50 years depending on how you count it we have talked about it endlessly over the last decade or so and we ve accomplished close to zip this is the growth rate of co 2 in the atmosphere you ve seen this in various forms but maybe you have n t seen this one what this shows is that the rate of growth of our emissions is accelerating and that it s accelerating even faster than what we thought was the worst case just a few years back so that red line there was something that a lot of skeptics said the environmentalists only put in the projections to make the projections look as bad as possible that emissions would never grow as fast as that red line but in fact they re growing faster here s some data from actually just 10 days ago which shows this year s minimum of the arctic sea ice and it s the lowest by far and the rate at which the arctic sea ice is going away is a lot quicker than models so despite all sorts of experts like me flying around the planet and burning jet fuel and politicians signing treaties in fact you could argue the net effect of all this has been negative because it s just consumed a lot of jet fuel no no in terms of what we really need to do to put the brakes on this very high inertial thing our big economy we ve really hardly started really we re doing this basically really not very much i do n t want to depress you too much the problem is absolutely soluble and even soluble in a way that s reasonably cheap cheap meaning sort of the cost of the military not the cost of medical care cheap meaning a few percent of gdp no this is really important to have this sense of scale so the problem is soluble and the way we should go about solving it is say dealing with electricity production which causes something like 43 or so percent and rising of co 2 emissions and we could do that by perfectly sensible things like conservation and wind power nuclear power and coal to co 2 capture which are all things that are ready for giant scale deployment and work all we lack is the action to actually spend the money to put those into place instead we spend our time talking but nevertheless that s not what i m going to talk to you about tonight what i m going to talk to you about tonight is stuff we might do if we did nothing and it s this stuff in the middle here which is what you do if you do n t stop the emissions quickly enough and you need to deal somehow break the link between human actions that change climate and the climate change itself and that s particularly important because of course while we can adapt to climate change and it s important to be honest here there will be some benefits to climate change oh yes i think it s bad i ve spent my whole life working to stop it but one of the reasons it s politically hard is there are winners and losers not all losers but of course the natural world polar bears i spent time skiing across the sea ice for weeks at a time in the high arctic they will completely lose and there s no adaption so this problem is absolutely soluble this geo engineering idea in it s simplest form is basically the following you could put signed particles say sulfuric acid particles sulfates into the upper atmosphere the stratosphere where they d reflect away sunlight and cool the planet and i know for certain that that will work not that there are n t side effects but i know for certain it will work and the reason is it s been done and it was done not by us not by me but by nature here s mount pinatubo in the early 90s that put a whole bunch of sulfur in the stratosphere with a sort of atomic bomb like cloud the result of that was pretty dramatic after that and some previous volcanoes we have you see a quite dramatic cooling of the atmosphere so this lower bar is the upper atmosphere the stratosphere and it heats up after these volcanoes but you ll notice that in the upper bar which is the lower atmosphere and the surface it cools down because we shielded the atmosphere a little bit there s no big mystery about it there s lots of mystery in the details and there s some bad side effects like it partially destroys the ozone layer and i ll get to that in a minute but it clearly cools down and one other thing it s fast it s really important to say so much of the other things that we ought to do like slowing emissions are intrinsically slow because it takes time to build all the hardware we need to reduce emissions and not only that when you cut emissions you do n t cut concentrations because concentrations the amount of co 2 in the air is the sum of emissions over time so you ca n t step on the brakes very quickly but if you do this it s quick and there are times you might like to do something quick another thing you might wonder about is does it work can you shade some sunlight and effectively compensate for the added co 2 and produce a climate sort of back to what it was originally and the answer seems to be yes so here are the graphs you ve seen lots of times before that s what the world looks like under one particular climate model s view with twice the amount of co 2 in the air the lower graph is with twice the amount of co 2 and 1 8 percent less sunlight and you re back to the original climate and this graph from ken caldeira it s important to say came because ken at a meeting that i believe marty hoffart was also at in the mid 90s ken and i stood up at the back of the meeting and said geo engineering wo n t work and to the person who was promoting it said the atmosphere s much more complicated gave a bunch of physical reasons why it would n t do a very good compensation ken went and ran his models and found that it did this topic is also old that report that landed on president johnson s desk when i was two years old 1965 that report in fact which had all the modern climate science the only thing they talked about doing was geo engineering it did n t even talk about cutting emissions which is an incredible shift in our thinking about this problem i m not saying we should n t cut emissions we should but it made exactly this point so in a sense there s not much new the one new thing is this essay so i should say i guess that since the time of that original president johnson report and the various reports of the u s national academy 1977 1982 1990 people always talked about this idea not as something that was foolproof but as an idea to think about but when climate became politically a hot topic if i may make the pun in the last 15 years this became so un pc we could n t talk about it it just sunk below the surface we were n t allowed to speak about it but in the last year paul crutzen published this essay saying roughly what s all been said before that maybe given our very slow rate of progress in solving this problem and the uncertain impacts we should think about things like this he said roughly what s been said before the big deal was he happened to have won the nobel prize for ozone chemistry and so people took him seriously when he said we should think about this even though there will be some ozone impacts and in fact he had some ideas to make them go away there was all sorts of press coverage all over the world going right down to dr strangelove saves the earth from the economist and that got me thinking i ve worked on this topic on and off but not so much technically and i was actually lying in bed thinking one night and i thought about this child s toy hence the title of my talk and i wondered if you could use the same physics that makes that thing spin round in the child s radiometer to levitate particles into the upper atmosphere and make them stay there one of the problems with sulfates is they fall out quickly the other problem is they re right in the ozone layer and i d prefer them above the ozone layer and it turns out i woke up the next morning and i started to calculate this it was very hard to calculate from first principles i was stumped but then i found out that there were all sorts of papers already published that addressed this topic because it happens already in the natural atmosphere so it seems there are already fine particles that are levitated up to what we call the mesosphere about 100 kilometers up that already have this effect i ll tell you very quickly how the effect works there are a lot of fun complexities that i d love to spend the whole evening on but i wo n t but let s say you have sunlight hitting some particle and it s unevenly heated so the side facing the sun is warmer the side away cooler gas molecules that bounce off the warm side bounce away with some extra velocity because it s warm and so you see a net force away from the sun that s called the photophoretic force there are a bunch of other versions of it that i and some collaborators have thought about how to exploit and of course we may be wrong this has n t all been peer reviewed we re in the middle of thinking about it but so far it seems good but it looks like we could achieve long atmospheric lifetimes much longer than before because they re levitated we can move things out of the stratosphere into the mesosphere in principle solving the ozone problem i m sure there will be other problems that arise finally we could make the particles migrate to over the poles so we could arrange the climate engineering so it really focused on the poles which would have minimal bad impacts in the middle of the planet where we live and do the maximum job of what we might need to do which is cooling the poles in case of planetary emergency if you like this is a new idea that s crept up that may be essentially a cleverer idea than putting sulfates in whether this idea is right or some other idea is right i think it s almost certain we will eventually think of cleverer things to do than just putting sulfur in that if engineers and scientists really turned their minds to this it s amazing how we can affect the planet the one thing about this is it gives us extraordinary leverage this improved science and engineering will whether we like it or not give us more and more leverage to affect the planet to control the planet to give us weather and climate control not because we plan it not because we want it just because science delivers it to us bit by bit with better knowledge of the way the system works and better engineering tools to effect it now suppose that space aliens arrived maybe they re going to land at the u n headquarters down the road here or maybe they ll pick a smarter spot but suppose they arrive and they give you a box and the box has two knobs one knob is the knob for controlling global temperature maybe another knob is a knob for controlling co 2 concentrations you might imagine that we would fight wars over that box because we have no way to agree about where to set the knobs we have no global governance and different people will have different places they want it set now i do n t think that s going to happen it s not very likely but we re building that box the scientists and engineers of the world are building it piece by piece in their labs even when they re doing it for other reasons even when they re thinking they re just working on protecting the environment they have no interest in crazy ideas like engineering the whole planet they develop science that makes it easier and easier to do and so i guess my view on this is not that i want to do it i do not but that we should move this out of the shadows and talk about it seriously because sooner or later we ll be confronted with decisions about this and it s better if we think hard about it even if we want to think hard about reasons why we should never do it i ll give you two different ways to think about this problem that are the beginning of my thinking about how to think about it but what we need is not just a few oddballs like me thinking about this we need a broader debate a debate that involves musicians scientists philosophers writers who get engaged with this question about climate engineering and think seriously about what its implications are so here s one way to think about it which is that we just do this instead of cutting emissions because it s cheaper i guess the thing i have n t said about this is it is absurdly cheap it s conceivable that say using the sulfates method or this method i ve come up with you could create an ice age at a cost of 001 percent of gdp it s very cheap we have a lot of leverage it s not a good idea but it s just important i ll tell you how big the lever is the lever is that big and that calculation is n t much in dispute you might argue about the sanity of it but the leverage is real so because of this we could deal with the problem simply by stopping reducing emissions and just as the concentrations go up we can increase the amount of geo engineering i do n t think anybody takes that seriously because under this scenario we walk further and further away from the current climate we have all sorts of other problems like ocean acidification that come from co 2 in the atmosphere anyway nobody but maybe one or two very odd folks really suggest this but here s a case which is harder to reject let s say that we do n t do geo engineering we do what we ought to do which is get serious about cutting emissions but we do n t really know how quickly we have to cut them there s a lot of uncertainty about exactly how much climate change is too much so let s say that we work hard and we actually do n t just tap the brakes but we step hard on the brakes and really reduce emissions and eventually reduce concentrations and maybe someday like 2075 october 23 we finally reach that glorious day where concentrations have peaked and are rolling down the other side and we have global celebrations and we ve actually started to you know we ve seen the worst of it but maybe on that day we also find that the greenland ice sheet is really melting unacceptably fast fast enough to put meters of sea level on the oceans in the next 100 years and remove some of the biggest cities from the map that s an absolutely possible scenario we might decide at that point that even though geo engineering was uncertain and morally unhappy that it s a lot better than not geo engineering and that s a very different way to look at the problem it s using this as risk control not instead of action it s saying that you do some geo engineering for a little while to take the worst of the heat off not that you d use it as a substitute for action but there is a problem with that view and the problem is the following knowledge that geo engineering is possible makes the climate impacts look less fearsome and that makes a weaker commitment to cutting emissions today this is what economists call a moral hazard and that s one of the fundamental reasons that this problem is so hard to talk about and in general i think it s the underlying reason that it s been politically unacceptable to talk about this but you do n t make good policy by hiding things in a drawer i ll leave you with three questions and then one final quote should we do serious research on this topic should we have a national research program that looks at this not just at how you would do it better but also what all the risks and downsides of it are right now you have a few enthusiasts talking about it some in a positive side some in a negative side but that s a dangerous state to be in because there s very little depth of knowledge on this topic a very small amount of money would get us some many of us maybe now me think we should do that but i have a lot of reservations my reservations are principally about the moral hazard problem and i do n t really know how we can best avoid the moral hazard i think there is a serious problem as you talk about this people begin to think they do n t need to work so hard to cut emissions another thing is maybe we need a treaty a treaty that decides who gets to do this right now we may think of a big rich country like the u s doing this but it might well be that in fact if china wakes up in 2030 and realizes that the climate impacts are just unacceptable they may not be very interested in our moral conversations about how to do this and they may just decide they d really rather have a geo engineered world than a non geo engineered world and we ll have no international mechanism to figure out who makes the decision so here s one last thought which was said much much better 25 years ago in the u s national academy report than i can say today and i think it really summarizes where we are here that the co 2 problem the climate problem that we ve heard about is driving lots of things innovations in the energy technologies that will reduce emissions but also i think inevitably it will drive us towards thinking about climate and weather control whether we like it or not and it s time to begin thinking about it even if the reason we re thinking about it is to construct arguments for why we should n t do it thank you very much
